Interview After Violent Berkeley Riots", "body": "Milo Yiannopoulos, the target of violent protestors, delivered his first formal interview since U.C. Berkeley riots that shocked the nation.  Appearing on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Milo detailed the chaos that unfolded at his planned speech on the subject of cultural appropriation, and how his evacuation transpired. \u201cSuddenly, there were these explosions outside,\u201d he began. \u201cThere were firecrackers and rocks being hurled at the building. The police were having things hurled at them.\u201d \u201cI was evacuated up to the fifth floor by the fire escape \u2013 it was all very exciting \u2013 and then suddenly, I was being taken out of the building. I was informed that I was being evacuated because there were hundreds of protesters outside, blowing things up\u2026 The police didn\u2019t seem to be doing much besides hiding inside the building.\u201d \u201cThe ground floor had been stormed, so we had to rush down to the parking lot, and find a car, but that exit was blocked,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we ran to another car\u2026 I was bundled in, put in a bulletproof vest, and whisked away. And that is the price you pay for being a libertarian or a conservative on American college campuses.\u201d Carlson affirmed Milo\u2019s assessment that the police were effectively carrying out \u2018stand down\u2019 procedures. While definitive proof has yet to be uncovered that a formal order of this kind was given to Berkeley police, the video evidence supports this hypothesis, and statements made by the mayor of Berkeley also reveal the city\u2019s attitude towards Yiannopoulos and protecting attendees of his event. A viral photo posted to Reddit claims to depict \u201cnearly 100 SWAT and campus police sitting inside the student union doing NOTHING while people were getting beaten outside.\u201d  Carlson and Yiannopoulos continued on to discuss the dangerous escalation of violence against conservatives and Trump supporters, and noted that it is being encouraged and validated by the mainstream media, as exemplified in CNN\u2019s commentary about the horrific riots, where they unabashedly slandered Milo\u2019s supporters as \u201cwhite supremacists.\u201d  The flamboyant and openly gay Yiannopoulos makes no secret of his affinity for the company of black men, and currently has a black boyfriend. Carlson noted that he was hard-pressed to find many liberals defending Milo\u2019s right to free speech, in stark contrast to the slew of Hollywood personalities and prominent leftists who are supporting the on-going brutality and targeting of American patriots.  last night i got a call from the UC Berkeley alum association asking for donations. wonder if they're psychic? time to donate, i think https://t.co/SRj8TlhtY2 \u2014 Adrienne Porter Felt (@__apf__) February 2, 2017   lmao berkeley https://t.co/hFt21Z7jqf \u2014 Hannah Jewell (@hcjewell) February 2, 2017   Milo\u2019s new book, Dangerous, recently hit #1 on the Amazon Best Sellers list, despite not being released until March 14.

Rioters Were \u201cRight-Wingers\u201d", "body": "In barely believable comments, UC Berkeley professor and former Democratic Secretary of Labor Robert Reich claimed on CNN that the rioters at Berkeley who violently attacked Trump supporters were actually \u201cright-wingers\u201d who were part of a conspiracy to make liberals look bad.  Yes, really. \u201cI was there for part of last night, and I know what I saw and those people were not Berkeley students,\u201d Reich told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon. \u201cThose people were outside agitators. I have never seen them before,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s rumors that they actually were right-wingers. They were a part of a kind of group that was organized and ready to create the kind of tumult and danger you saw that forced the police to cancel the event,\u201d Reich ludicrously asserted. \u201cSo Donald Trump, when he says Berkeley doesn\u2019t respect free speech rights, that\u2019s a complete distortion of the truth.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s a strategy by [Milo Yiannopoulos] or right-wingers?\u201d asked Lemon. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet against it,\u201d Reich responded. \u201cI saw these people. They all looked very\u2013 almost paramilitary. They were not from the campus. I don\u2019t want to say factually, but I\u2019ve heard there was some relationship here between these people and the right-wing movement that is affiliated with Breitbart News.\u201d We\u2019ve seen the leftist media refuse to condemn and in some cases even celebrate the vicious assaults on people for exercising their right to free speech that took place on Wednesday night, but for someone to claim that the entire sequence of events was a vast right-wing conspiracy is even more bizarre. Reich\u2019s absurd comments shouldn\u2019t even be dignified with a rebuttal, suffice to say that the same black-clad Antifa leftists have been rioting their way through cities up and down the country for weeks, including at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington DC. Was that all a secret right-wing plot too? Milo\u2019s speeches have also been shut down and interrupted by leftists in numerous different cities for the best part of a year. Were all those incidents cooked up by Milo\u2019s fans too? These remarks illustrate once again how the left is willing to completely disconnect itself from reality when they are soundly trounced on a narrative. The Democratic establishment and the mainstream media have been legitimizing violent riots and physical attacks on Trump supporters for the best part of 18 months. And then when it actually happens, some of them retreat into the twilight zone so that they don\u2019t have to face the blame.

Daughter of Pro-Trump Journalist", "body": "A member of the violent Antifa movement publicly threatened a pro-Trump journalist\u2019s young daughter, vowing to target conservative commentators \u201cand their kids\u201d. Cassandra Fairbanks, a reporter who formerly identified as a Bernie-supporting Democrat but later switched her allegiance to Trump, received the threat from a group identifying itself as the \u2018Arizona Antifa Front\u2019. \u201cSome of us know you very personally cass, and know just how afraid you can really get. Be careful doll, for ur duaghters sake,\u201d the tweet read. The word \u2018daughter\u2019 was misspelled. Left wing organization threatens the young daughter of a journalist they don't like. pic.twitter.com/cskdRsZIhe \u2014 Mike Cernovich ???? (@Cernovich) February 3, 2017  The individual deleted the tweet, but only after she was forced to do so by Twitter to regain access to her account. However, in a subsequent tweet, the threat was re-stated. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch you another time cass, this isnt the last you\u2019ve heard (or seen ;o ) of us honey.\u201d we'll catch you another time cass, this isnt the last you've heard (or seen ;o ) of us honey. \u2014 AZ Antifa Front (@azantifa) February 3, 2017  The account then sent out a threat to conservative commentators and Trump supporters that their children would be targeted too. \u201cu better believe we have no prblm threatening ur leaders and their kids. Watch ur back alt-reichers. No one\u2019s off limits,\u201d read another tweet. 2/2 @azantifa Then u better believe we have no prblm threatening ur leaders and their kids. Watch ur back alt-reichers. No one's off limits. \u2014 AZ Antifa Front (@azantifa) February 3, 2017  While numerous alt-right Twitter users have been permanently suspended in recent weeks for expressing unpopular opinions or engaging in alleged \u201charassment,\u201d the tech giant presumably doesn\u2019t think that threatening people\u2019s children constitutes harassment since the Antifa account is still active. Fairbanks later identified the culprit as a woman and said she would be contacting the FBI about the threat. Sweet girl falls for bad boy in 2012, becomes junkie, wrong crowd, threatens children on internet 4 years later. A tragic tale. pic.twitter.com/49cbl4ntyu \u2014 Cassandra Fairbanks (@CassandraRules) February 3, 2017  Fairbanks also shared tweets she had received from another Antifa supporter who made vulgar threats against her daughter and hoped for her to be \u201chit by a car\u201d. @Cernovich these sick fucks have been doing it for days. pic.twitter.com/PARHfPyUlt \u2014 Cassandra Fairbanks (@CassandraRules) February 3, 2017  A change.org petition to declare Antifa a terrorist organization has been signed by thousands of people. Given that the group engages in violence to further a political objective, the designation is completely apt.

counter-extremism program solely on Islam \u2013 sources", "body": "The Trump administration wants to revamp and rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on Islamist extremism, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters. The program, \u201cCountering Violent Extremism,\u201d or CVE, would be changed to \u201cCountering Islamic Extremism\u201d or \u201cCountering Radical Islamic Extremism,\u201d the sources said, and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States. Such a change would reflect Trump\u2019s election campaign rhetoric and criticism of former President Barack Obama for being weak in the fight against Islamic State and for refusing to use the phrase \u201cradical Islam\u201d in describing it. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in several countries. The CVE program aims to deter groups or potential lone attackers through community partnerships and educational programs or counter-messaging campaigns in cooperation with companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O).

Begins In Few Months, Will Be Complete In Two Years", "body": "TEXAS\u00a0\u2013 In his first television interview as Homeland Security secretary, retired four-star Marine Gen. John F. Kelly told Fox News he wants the U.S.-Mexico border wall finished in two years \u2013 setting an ambitious schedule for the project ordered last week by President Trump. \u201cThe wall will be built where it\u2019s needed first, and then it will be filled in. That\u2019s the way I look at it,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI really hope to have it done within the next two years.\u201d Fox News traveled with Kelly in McAllen, Texas, on Wednesday where he saw first-hand the challenges for Border Patrol agents. The Rio Grande Valley, known as the \u201cRGV sector,\u201d is among the busiest. On any given day, Border Patrol agents pick up at least 600 people who have crossed the Mexican border, entering the U.S. illegally. Those personnel, he explained, are all part of the broader plan for securing the border. \u201cAny discussion about the protection of our southwest border involves discussion of physical barriers but also of technological sensors, things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a layered approach, and it\u2019s got to be backed up by great men and women who are going to make sure that the wall is intact.\u201d But first, the department faces the tough task of funding \u2013 and then building \u2013 what would be the largest-ever construction project undertaken by the president who made his name in real estate. Kelly, who was tasked by the president\u2019s executive order with overseeing the planning and construction of the wall, echoed Trump in saying they already \u201chave the authority\u201d under existing law. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the money aspect,\u201d he acknowledged. But he said the White House is working with Congress on the timetable.

Protests Shows Americans Support Trump Travel Ban", "body": "A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted after last weekend\u2019s mass protests against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on individuals from terror-linked countries shows that a majority of Americans support the policy by a margin of 49-41%. \u201cThe Jan. 30-31 poll found that 49 percent of American adults said they either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d agreed with Trump\u2019s order, while 41 percent \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d disagreed and another 10 percent said they don\u2019t know,\u201d reports Reuters. As Chris Menahan points out, despite the poll results representing a clear positive for Trump\u2019s policy, they were not reported that way. \u201cEven though there\u2019s an 8 point gap in favor of the ban, Reuters said \u201cslightly more\u201d approved than disapproved. Additionally, their headline was the tame: \u201cTrump\u2019s travel ban polarizes America.\u201d The poll is roughly in line with another survey conducted by Rasmussen before the protests that showed 57-33% support for the travel ban. In other words, despite wall to wall media condemnation of the policy and nationwide demonstrations, some of them violent, a clear majority of Americans still support the measure. In a related story, another poll conducted by YouGov shows that a clear majority of Brits support Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to the United Kingdom, by a margin of 49-36%. This confounds the narrative pushed by the media that Trump was unwelcome after over a million people signed an online petition.

Official Admits Global Warming Agenda Is Really About Destroying Capitalism", "body": "A shocking statement was made by a United Nations official\u00a0Christiana Figueres at a\u00a0news conference in Brussels. Figueres admitted that the Global Warming conspiracy set by the U.N.\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change, of which she is the executive secretary, has a\u00a0goal not of environmental activists is not to save the world from ecological calamity, but to destroy capitalism. She said very casually: \u201cThis is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.\u201d She even restated that goal ensuring it was not a mistake: \u201cThis is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.\u201d  All of these movements seem to have a hidden agenda that the press helps to misrepresent all the time. One must wonder, at what point will the press realize they are destroying their own future? Investors.com reminds Figueres that the only economic model in the last 150 years that has ever worked at all is capitalism. The evidence is prima facie: From a feudal order that lasted a thousand years, produced zero growth and kept workdays long and lifespans short, the countries that have embraced free-market capitalism have enjoyed a system in which output has increased 70-fold, work days have been halved and lifespans doubled.", "author_name": "Martin Armstrong", "links": ["#content", "/",

Illegal Guns to Protect Themselves From Migrant Attacks", "body": "Hundreds of Germans have purchased illegal guns from a website called \u201cMigrants fright\u201d in a bid to protect themselves against escalating attacks from newly arrived \u201crefugees\u201d. \u201cDo you want your town to become a lawless arena for asylum seekers? Think you need to protect your women?\u201d asks a promo ad for the website, which has since been shut down. The German branch of left-wing website VICE.com managed to obtain a customer list from the website before dispatching journalists to make home visits in an effort to shame individuals who purchased guns and ammunition and had them delivered by DHL. The men responsible for the website subsequently claimed that it was legal because it was based in Hungary, where gun laws are less strict. German laws state that all weapons have to be registered and pre-approved by authorities. Customers came from all different socio-economic backgrounds and cited fear of migrant attacks as their reason for buying the weapons. \u201cPeople from other countries, of course, have different ideas about how to behave in society. Uncontrolled immigration is a problem, we need a 180-degree u-turn,\u201d said a doctor from Munich who purchased firearms via the website. Demand for weapons has surged in Germany since the 2015 mass sex attacks in Cologne committed predominantly by Moroccan migrants in addition to several high profile terrorist incidents, culminating in December\u2019s atrocity when a Tunisian asylum seeker drove a truck through a crowd of people at a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 and injuring 56. Figures released in May last year showed that the number of people who applied for small weapons licenses in Bavaria over the first three months of 2016 was already double the number for the whole of 2015.

Mayor Khan Approaches 75,000 Signatures", "body": "A petition seeking to unseat the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is rapidly closing in on the 75,000 signature goal set forth by its creator. Khan has pushed back aggressively against the Brexit campaign, and petitioners are concerned that he may even be hoping to lead a \u201c#Londependence\u201d movement, which would seek to create an independent state of London that remains subservient to the European Union, while the rest of the United Kingdom would not. Khan has warned, \u201cA hard Brexit would cut Europe off from its only truly global financial center. This would be bad news for Europe as well as Britain. So a hard Brexit really would be a lose-lose situation.\u201d Those who support national sovereignty and realize that the EU is a detriment to the future of Great Britain, would disagree. Khan has also been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump\u2019s moratorium on immigration and travel from jihadist hot zones, even demanding that Trump cancel his state visit to the UK.  Londoners voted to Remain in the European Union, by a margin of 2.2 million votes to 1.5 million in favor of Brexit. That said, not surprisingly, the\u00a0most popular baby name in London for 2016 was Muhammad/Mohammed, by an overwhelming margin. The petition reads as follows \u2013 As a country we voted against the Tyranny of the European Union and voted out, however the remain supporters are trying to create civil unrest in the UK and by asking for London to be an independent state, shows the lack of understanding of why we have a North and South divide here in the UK. As the Mayor of London,\u00a0Sadiq Khan has a position of power in the capital and with this power he should be discouraging any such action from those who wish to create London as an independent state. London is the Capital city of the \u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d and not the European Union and therefore\u00a0Sadiq Khan needs to be removed as Mayor of London. His statement\u00a0\u201ccrucial that London has a voice at the table during those renegotiation\u2019s\u201d, shows that he is encouraging those who created the petition calling for London to be an independent state. By encouraging those to engage in such actions, shows a disregard for the democratic process to which this country voted by a majority to leave.\u00a0 If his statement\u00a0\u201ccrucial that London has a voice at the table during those renegotiation\u2019s\u201d, then so should the rest of the cities across the United Kingdom as London is only the \u201cFinancial\u201d Capital when the rest of the country are the core backbone of our economy. If he continues with this line, then he is creating treasonous actions by this encouragement towards those who are bitter about leaving the European Union and our laws must be enacted in order to stop civil unrest in the UK and removing him as Mayor is one such action. Any actions that undermine the democratic process of the United Kingdom is treasonous and is written into law, our democratic process is marked by Royal Seal and protected by our Monarchy which was signed under the Magna Carta.

lie:\u2019 Mexico denies Trump threatened to send troops against \u2018bad hombres\u2019", "body": "After the AP and Mexican media reported that Trump had threatening to send the US military to chase \u201cbad hombres\u201d out of Mexico in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the Mexican government has slammed the claim as \u201ca downright lie.\u201d The statement\u00a0\u201cdid not happen during that call,\u201d\u00a0the Mexican government\u00a0said\u00a0on Twitter. \u201cI know it with absolute certainty, there was no threat. The things that have been said are nonsense and a downright lie,\u201dPe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s spokesman, Eduardo Sanchez, said in a radio interview. Mexico\u2019s foreign relations department slammed the report, saying its allegations were\u00a0\u201cbased on absolute falsehoods\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cdo not correspond to the reality at all.\u201d \u201cThe tone was constructive and it was agreed by the presidents to continue working and that the teams will continue to meet frequently to construct an agreement that is positive for Mexico and for the United States,\u201d\u00a0the department added, as cited by AP. The White House has refused to comment, instead pointing to a joint statement regarding the call that appeared on Friday. The two leaders reportedly spoke about the need to\u00a0\u201cwork together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales.\u201d At a press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May last week, Trump also described his call with Pena Nieto as\u00a0\u201cfriendly.\u201d A few hours before the statement from the Mexican government was released, the AP and a Mexican news website called Aristegui Noticias\u00a0reported\u00a0that Trump had mentioned the possibility of sending US troops to Mexico to stop\u00a0\u201cbad hombres down there.\u201d The media outlets cited an excerpt of an alleged transcript of the phone call that they claim they had obtained. \u201cYou have a bunch of bad hombres down there,\u201d\u00a0AP cited Trump as saying. \u201cYou aren\u2019t doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn\u2019t, so I just might send them down to take care of it,\u201d\u00a0the US president allegedly added This isn\u2019t the first time Trump is reported to have used the term\u00a0\u201cbad hombres.\u201d\u00a0During a presidential debate in October, he pledged to eradicate\u00a0\u201cdrug lords\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cbad people,\u201d\u00a0saying\u00a0\u201cwe have some bad hombres here, and we\u2019re going to get them out.\u201d The term has been viral ever since, inciting immense uproar, both on- and offline. I knew they were trouble. #badhombres #Debatenight pic.twitter.com/WCth3SIgW9 \u2014 Karen Scian (@karenscian) October 20, 2016   I hear the bathrooms in Trump Tower are being relabeled \"Bad Hombres\" and \"Nasty Women.\" \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 20, 2016   Donald Trump Inspires Bathroom Signs at Bill Clinton Rally in Pensacola, FL#NastyWomen #BadHombreshttps://t.co/Ikh8OoMItx pic.twitter.com/7BmLVx3e1M \u2014 kalani brady (@InsecureDonald) October 23, 2016   Tensions between the US and Mexico have escalated since Trump once again raised the issue of building a wall between the two countries \u2013 at Mexico\u2019s expense. Afterwards, Pena Nieto canceled his trip to the US that had been scheduled for January 31, while Trump said he would be unable to visit Mexico if its leadership refuses to pay for the wall. Adding fuel to the fire, last week, the White House suggested imposing a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico in order to finance the wall. The countries carry out some $1.6 billion in cross-border trade daily. \n", "author_name": "RT", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

Talk Business With Euroskeptic Hungary", "body": "Vladimir Putin is paying a return visit to Budapest, a year after Viktor Orban\u2019s trip to Moscow set the tone for enhanced bilateral cooperation.  The two leaders, similarly unpopular in Brussels, are set to discuss current and prospective mutually lucrative trade deals. The visit comes during tense times between the EU and Russia, which is facing an ongoing sanction regime coupled with an unprecedented NATO troop buildup on its borders. The global geopolitical situation is, according to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, however, way more favorable than during Putin\u2019s previous visit to the country in 2015. Putin\u2019s first official trip in 2017 is set to bolster bilateral agreements reached during Orban\u2019s February 2016 visit to Moscow. The two leaders are expected to focus on joint economic and trade projects, according\u00a0to Kremlin. Putin and Orban will also likely discuss cooperation within the frameworks of the Nord Stream and Turkish stream gas pipeline projects, Russia\u2019s presidential aide, Yuri Ushakov told reporters on Wednesday. About 85 percent of Hungary\u2019s gas flows in from Russia. In 2015, Putin and Orban signed a new gas agreement replacing a 20-year contract that had expired in December 2015. Hungary pays only for gas it actually consumes under the agreement, which proved to be very lucrative for low-demand consumers. Another key issue, which is expected to be discussed during the visit is the expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant. Russia and Hungary signed an agreement on the construction of two additional reactors in January 2014. Eighty percent of the project\u2019s cost will be funded by a \u20ac10bn credit line from Russia, and work will be performed by Russian nuclear scientists. Budapest is currently awaiting approval of the project by EU bureaucrats who have been blocking it. The Hungarian PM has been classed as the \u2018black sheep\u2019 of European politics because of his views on key EU issues, which frequently contradicts the mainstream establishment view. Orban\u2019s skepticism towards the so called \u2018open-borders\u2019 policy and anti-Russia agenda has drawn criticism from many bigwigs on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, publicly greeted Orban as \u201cthe dictator\u201d at the Eastern Partnership summit in 2015. While US Republican Senator John McCain even went as far as to brand\u00a0the Hungarian PM a \u201cneo-fascist dictator\u201d in a December 2014 Senate address. Orban insists\u00a0that he simply wants what\u2019s good for his country, and that he \u201cwould not be a viceroy in Hungary commissioned by some foreign state.\u201d His views on migration policy and desire to actually control his country\u2019s borders proved to be quite visionary and realistic considering Europe\u2019s migrant crisis. While Budapest went along with the EU sanctions against Moscow over the Ukraine, it has been criticizing Brussels\u2019 anti-Russia stance ever since. Ahead of Putin\u2019s visit, the Hungarian Foreign Minister reiterated that position. \u201cHungary\u2019s position on the [anti-Russian] sanctions is that [they are] useless,\u201d Szijjarto told Reuters. In 2014, Orban said Europe \u201cshot itself in the foot\u201d as the sanctions policy \u201ccauses more harm to us than to Russia.\u201d Szijjarto\u2019s assessment appears to be spot on as his country\u2019s economic losses amounts to billions of dollars. \u201cAccording to our estimates, the loss of profit for Hungary amounts to $6.5 billion over the last three years,\u201d Szijjarto told\u00a0Kommersant daily. \u201cWe are speaking about exports. Given that the annual volume of Hungarian exports is about $90 billion, the losses are biting.\u201d\n", "author_name": "RT", "links": ["#content", "/",

Terrorist Havens In Search For ISIS Operatives", "body": "German police launched a major raid on 54\u00a0suspected terrorist locations Tuesday in search of Islamic State adherents believed to be involved planning an attack. The operation took place in the western state of Hesse, and targeted a 36-year-old Tunisian man who was arrested in Frankfurt around 4 a.m. local time, according to a report from BNO news. Authorities accused the man of recruiting and smuggling on behalf of the terrorist group, and believe he created a cell of supporters in the area. Hessian state police said in a statement that 1,100 police officers were involved in the massive raid, which targeted various mosques, businesses, and homes across the area. The suspects are said to range in age from 16 to 46, but it is unclear how many people were arrested in total. Police believe the ISIS cell planning was in the early stages, and that a target had yet to be chosen. The operation followed a Tuesday raid in Berlin, which led to the arrest of three suspected ISIS members who were believed to be planning an attack. Police also raided Berlin\u2019s \u201cFussilet\u201d mosque, a known hotbed of extremism frequented by ISIS terrorist Anis Amri before he killed 11 Germans at a Christmas market in December.",

Decriminalizes Official Misconduct", "body": "Corruption now comes in two forms in Romania.

The country\u2019s governing Social Democratic Party shocked domestic and international observers Tuesday when it adopted an emergency measure to decriminalize official misconduct causing damage worth less than about $48,000. Thousands of Romanians protested the decision, calling it a blow to recent progress in fighting chronic corruption in a European Union nation where accusations of bribe-taking, favor-trading and bureaucratic abuses are part of everyday life. The directive will stop ongoing investigations and prevent new ones from being launched. Another decree might end up freeing convicted officials from prison. Officially, the measure is supposed to prevent \u201cprison overcrowding.\u201d According to numbers published by the European Court of Human Rights, worsening prison conditions in the country have indeed been a major concern recently.

10,000 Refugees After Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "body": "American coffee house chain Starbucks has announced plans to hire 10,000 refugees around the world over the next five years. The announcement comes two days after US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning refugees from certain Muslim countries. In a letter to employees, Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz said the company would do everything possible to support affected workers. He said the hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States with the focus on immigrants \u201cwho have served with US troops as interpreters and support personnel.\u201d \u201cI am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack,\u201d Schultz said, adding that Starbucks would aim to communicate with workers more frequently. On Friday President Trump put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries. He explained the decision, which has sparked widespread international criticism, as motivated by the urge to be \u201cprotecting our own citizens and border.\u201d According to the Starbucks CEO, the company plans to strengthen its business in the \u201ccritically important market\u201d of Mexico, which has also been a target of Trump\u2019s policies. The US president wants to build a wall on the border with Mexico to stem illegal immigration. Schultz said the company has been open for business in Mexico since 2002, and have since opened almost 600 stores in 60 cities across the country, which together employ over 7,000 Mexican people. He added that Starbucks would help support coffee growers in Mexico, provide health insurance to eligible workers if the health care law is repealed and employees lose health care coverage. \u201cWe stand ready to help and support our Mexican customers, partners and their families as they navigate what impact proposed trade sanctions, immigration restrictions and taxes might have on their business and their trust of Americans. But we will continue to invest in this critically important market all the same,\u201d\u00a0Schultz said. \n", "author_name": "RT", "links": ["#content", "/",

Official Phone Call Between Putin and Trump", "body": "The highly anticipated telephone call between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump will take place on Saturday at 8 pm Moscow time (12 pm in Washington, DC). Sputnik presents what we know so far about the topics likely to be discussed by the two leaders during the historic telephone call. On Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov confirmed that President Putin will be the sole participant from the Russian side in his telephone conversation with Donald Trump. Earlier, the White House reported that Vice President Mike Pence would be sitting in on President Trump\u2019s conversation with the Russian leader, and would join the discussion. As far as the conversation\u2019s subject matter is concerned, all that is known for sure is that Putin will formally congratulate Trump on assuming office as the 45th president of the United States. Otherwise, Peskov and the Kremlin have been tight-lipped about the subjects to be discussed. \u201cOf course, usually during such contacts there is an exchange of views on the main parameters of the current state of bilateral relations,\u201d the spokesman said Friday. The White House has also been rather hush-hush about the talks, but has dropped hints about at least one possible topic of discussion. On Thursday, President Trump told Fox News that Putin called him after his election victory to offer his congratulations, but that the two men didn\u2019t have a substantive discussion. More than anything, Trump said that he would like it if Moscow and Washington could fight Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) together. \u201cI don\u2019t know Putin, but if we can get along with Russia, that\u2019s a great thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for Russia, it\u2019s good for us; we go out together and knock the hell out of ISIS, because that\u2019s a real sickness,\u201d he added. On the campaign trail, Trump said repeatedly that the US would be better off cooperating with Russia in the global struggle against radical Islamic terrorism, and complained that President Obama\u2019s White House \u2018didn\u2019t even know\u2019 who the anti-Assad rebels the US was funding actually were, alluding that they may be affiliated with terrorists. This week, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Russian aircraft in Syria had conducted airstrikes based on US intelligence. The Pentagon quickly denied the reports, something Russian observers suggested was a bashful attempt to try to smooth the continued transition from Obama-era policy. Accordingly, given President Trump\u2019s strong feelings on the subject, it seems very likely that anti-Daesh cooperation will be a linchpin in Saturday\u2019s telephone conversation. However, based on Washington\u2019s reaction to reports of Russian-US intelligence cooperation earlier this week, the results of the talks may remain a secret, at least for now. Also on the table is the subject of US sanctions against Russia, introduced by the Obama administration in 2014 over the crisis in Ukraine. On Friday, Trump said that it\u2019s \u201cvery early to be talking about [lifting the sanctions].\u201d Still, the President added that he also hopes to follow through with his campaign promise to foster improved relations with Moscow. However, earlier on Friday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway let slip to Fox News that sanctions relief would be \u201cunder consideration\u201d in Saturday\u2019s call. \u201cAll of that is under consideration,\u201d Conway said, after being asked whether the fate of sanctions slapped on Moscow by the Obama administration would be on the agenda for the talks.  The sanctions issue has split President Trump from his own party. Senior US lawmakers, including Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have insisted that sanctions against Russia must stay in place. Other lawmakers, including Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, are even considering a bill to try to limit Trump\u2019s ability to lift the sanctions without Congressional approval. According to Russian observers, other topics of discussion may include nuclear weapons and missile defense. Speaking to RBTH, Sergei Karaganov, honorary chairman of the Russian Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, said that it was critically important that Moscow and Washington find a solution \u201cbased not on the reduction or increase of nuclear arsenals, but on the preservation of the global status quo.\u201d Earlier this month, prior to his inauguration, Trump indicated that Washington may tie the lifting of sanctions against Moscow to a major nuclear arms reduction treaty between the two powers. Russian officials responded by saying that Moscow would not be willing to make sacrifices in the field of security for sanctions relief, but added that dialogue was important in resolving any outstanding security issues between the two countries.\nFinally, another important topic that may find its way on the agenda of Saturday\u2019s talks is European security, and specifically the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and Russian-NATO tensions in Eastern Europe. In recent years, NATO has upped its deployment of troops and heavy equipment on Russia\u2019s doorstep, culminating earlier this month in the deployment of a brigade of US troops in Poland, days before the end of Obama\u2019s tenure. According to Karaganov, while one telephone conversation between the presidents certainly wouldn\u2019t be enough to end the tensions, it could be the first positive step to doing so. The most optimistic scenario, Karaganov said, would be \u201cfreez[ing] the situation on a bilateral basis, including in Ukraine,\u201d along with an agreement on \u201ccontacts between NATO\u2019s military and Russia with the aim of freeing ourselves from this completely useless, artificial confrontation.\u201d Ultimately, whatever subjects are broached and whatever agreements may be reached, the most important outcome of the talks will probably be the formal establishment of normal working contacts between Presidents Putin and Trump. From here, the two leaders can go on to discuss, and try to find agreement on, the many important bilateral and global issues that will accompany them over at least the next four years.\n",

Participation Rate Improves in January", "body": "The Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released its first look at employment since Donald Trump became president, and although that report does not reflect actual Trump policy changes, it does include the period just before Trump became president and was tweeting about jobs saved. According to BLS, the labor force participation rate improved in January, increasing two-tenths of a point to 62.9 percent, its best showing in four months. BLS said 152,081,000 Americans were employed in January, close to last month\u2019s record 152,111,000. At the same time, the number of Americans not in the labor force went in the right direction, dropping to 94,366,000, which is 736,000 fewer than last month\u2019s record 95,102,000. In January, the nation\u2019s civilian noninstitutionalized population, consisting of all people age 16 or older who were not in the military or an institution, reached 254,082,000.\u00a0 Of those, 159,716,000 participated in the labor force by either holding a job or actively seeking one.

"body": "2017 is off with a drab whisper as the FOMC, as expected, kept the Fed Funds rate target unchanged at .5-.75%. Further, there was no mention of the alleged three 2017 hikes, which \u201cexperts\u201d might consider as to be dovish move. The Press Release was optimistic about the economy and cited a strengthening labor market, economic expansion, and consumer sentiment. Perhaps they haven\u2019t seen the delicate fourth quarter GDP numbers? One of the themes of 2017 is the issue of the Fed Balance Sheet and whether the Fed is going to be talking up some sort of effort toward shrinking it. On this front, we read: \u201cThe Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.\u201d Because the Fed would likely begin balance sheet changes by halting\u2014 or at least slowing down\u2014 the amount of \u201creinvestments,\u201d this statement is indicating that it has no actual plans to address the balance sheet in the foreseeable future. Go figure. But the statement also emphasizes that addressing the balance sheet won\u2019t take place under the FedFunds rate normalization process is much further down the road. This, coupled with the decisions to not touch the Fed Funds target and not even mention 2017 rate hikes indicates that the balance sheet topic probably wont be seriously discussed for some time. Of course, touching the balance sheet is something the Fed is quite fearful of. Pricking the bubble is a massive no-no that the bureaucrats in every position in Washington want to avoid like the plague. The FOMC (non)decision is typical of what we have come to expect from the Fed. They pretend like they are optimistic about the economy, while at the same time they bend over backwards to not upset those who depend on such radically \u201cloose monetary policy.\u201d It\u2019s the most damaging and devastating example of \u201ckicking the can down the road\u201d that the world has ever seen. But those in power and their lobbyists are addicted to easy money. And so they keep it flowing and never look back.\n", "author_name": "Mises.org", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

Up This Obama Rule That Hurts Businesses", "body": "Republicans in the\u00a0House of Representatives\u00a0have proposed legislation that would\u00a0stop regulations requiring federal contractors to report any and all labor violations. The joint\u00a0resolution, proposed Monday by North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, makes use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) of 1996, which allows Congress to overturn executive actions, and has only been used once before. All Congress has\u00a0to do is pass the simple\u00a0joint resolution in both the House and the Senate, and \u201csuch rule shall have no force or effect.\u201d The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule,\u00a0signed by President Barack Obama in 2014, would have denied federal\u00a0contracts to large firms with any history of labor violations, and require firms competing for contracts to voluntarily provide the government with\u00a0any allegations of employer misconduct. One of the big issues is that companies\u00a0could lose or be denied contracts based on alleged labor violations, whether or not the allegations were accurate. The rule was finalized Aug. 25, 2016, but due to a series of lawsuits, a Texas federal court issued a temporary injunction on the rule in October,\u00a0a decision the federal government is still appealing. Companies \u201cwould likely be impaired by the arbitrary and unnecessary burdens imposed,\u201d U.S. District Judge Marcia Crone said in the written order of injunction\u00a0in October. \u201cBy these actions, the Executive Branch appears to have departed from Congress\u2019s explicit instructions dictating how violations of the labor law statutes are to be addressed,\u201d said Crone, who is a\u00a0George W. Bush-appointed Texas judge. Invoking the CRA\u00a0points to ways Congress could overturn other Obama administration rules, as President Donald Trump would likely not veto the legislation if it passes both the House and Senate. Trump has been\u00a0vocal about repealing federal regulations, and signed an executive order Monday requiring\u00a0federal agencies to\u00a0repeal two regulations for every rule that goes into effect. Congress has only successfully overturned regulations with\u00a0the CRA once before to overturn Clinton-era rules on safety in the workplace in 2001, just after former President George W. Bush took office.\n", "author_name": "Daily Caller", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/", "http://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerickJones",

The order will expand regulatory review with the goal of dramatically peeling back federal regulations. The order is the Trump administration\u2019s first step in repealing two regulations for every new regulation put forth, CNBC reports. The measure also sets a $0 budget for new regulations in 2017, and a cap on the cost of any new regulations going forward. Once in effect, it will require federal agencies to propose any new regulatory rules to the White House for official review. \u201cThis will be the biggest such act that our country has ever seen. There will be regulation, there will be control, but it will be normalized control,\u201d Trump told reporters as he signed the executive order.

Trump on Friday signed executive orders to suspend travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries on grounds of national security, while also banning refugees from Syria. Thousands of people rallied in major U.S. cities and at airports in protest. Nike and Starbucks were among the companies that did not support the ban. \u201cThe market is reacting negatively right now because of the uncertainty that it creates,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth.

Mocked Unemployed Americans Behind Closed Doors", "body": "IN 2011, UNEMPLOYMENT WAS at a near crisis level. The jobless rate was stuck around 9 percent nationally, an unusually high number due to the continuing effects of the financial crash. House Democrats were aghast. \u201cWith almost five unemployed Americans for every job opening, too many people remain jobless because of a lack of work, not a lack of wanting to work,\u201d said Congressman Lloyd Doggett, D-Tex. So in early November 2011, they introduced a bill to reauthorize Federal unemployment benefits, an insurance program designed to aide those looking for work. Behind closed doors at the Federal Reserve however, the conversation struck a different tone.

2017 Forecast", "body": "Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s\u00a0recent speech\u00a0at Stanford University certainly was much like Ms. Yellen herself: predictable and safe.  She is less opaque than Alan Greenspan, and less combative that Ben Bernanke. But she shares both men\u2019s ability to say very little that is interesting or controversial. Yellen opened with self-congratulatory Fed-speak. Citing the falling official unemployment number as a sign of Central Planner heroism, Yellen completely washes over the troubling reality of the participation rate. The statisticians, in true form, put the attention on how many in the labor force have a job, but shoo away the fact that the denominator\u2014 the labor force itself\u2014 is hardly in a healthy state. After all, if tens of millions who need a job have given up looking and are no longer calculated in the labor force, how can this be a labor market recovery? Consider the problem in graph form, courtesy of Jeff Snider at Alhambra Partners. Yellen expressed resolve to achieve even more devaluation of the currency on her quest toward 2% inflation. Of course, being well-trained central bankers Yellen and Co. are completely oblivious that their interest rate manipulation devastates the very pillar of a sound economy: the intertemporal structure of production. The aim to \u201cheat up\u201d the economy by tampering with interest rates doesn\u2019t just put upward pressure on consumer prices, it also sets the economy up for a future recession. Yellen thoroughly defends the honor of the discretionary policy advocates by clearly warning about the dangers of a policy rule. That is, whether monetary policy should be left up to the \u201cdiscretion\u201d of the FOMC (discretionary monetary policy) or in accordance with predetermined rules, such as the Taylor Rule, Yellen upholds the former. She argues that the Fed needs a level of flexibility to respond to unforeseen events that various \u201crules\u201d don\u2019t provide. Of course, this entire debate over discretionary vs. rule-based is ludicrous: both of these positions aim to set money supply and interest rates at variance with what the market would provide. What we need is the market to properly allocate scarce capital according to price signals and in response to the desires and decisions of individual actors throughout \u201cthe economy.\u201d In other words, we don\u2019t need more \u201cpolicy.\u201d We\u2019ve suffered enough.\n", "author_name": "Mises.org", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

\u2018Transform\u2019 Global Oil Market", "body": "The Republican Party\u2019s proposed shift to border-adjusted corporate tax (BTA) could have a significant impact on the global oil market, pushing US crude prices higher and triggering large-scale domestic production, said analysts at Goldman Sachs. The border tax intends to boost US manufacturing by taxing imports while exempting US business export revenues from corporate taxation. \u201cIf implemented, the impacts on the oil market would be significant,\u201d Goldman said. The switch to BTA would lift US crude futures 25 percent over global prices and provide an incentive for local producers to boost output. \u201cWe expect WTI [US crude benchmark \u2013 Ed.] could move to a $10 per barrel premium to Brent from a $3 discount \u2013 a $13 (+25 percent) relative move immediately,\u201d Goldman said. It warned that while global crude market is only starting to rebalance, the ramp up in US production would create a renewed large oil surplus next year. That could lead to an immediate sharp decline in global oil prices, Goldman said. According to the bank, in the medium-term, the impact on oil prices would depend on \u201chow quickly US production reacts to higher prices versus how quickly the rest of the world reacts to make space for higher US production.\u201d \u201cIf 2017-2018 WTI oil prices move to $68 per barrel, our analysis implies the incremental investment could result in 1.5 million barrels per day of 2018 US oil growth,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cUnless OPEC cuts further, this could oversupply global oil markets and potentially lead to another oil boom-bust cycle.\u201d It also said it sees Brent prices coming down to $50 per barrel in 2019, assuming a 15 percent appreciation in the US dollar upon implementation of the BTA, and a 30 percent pass-through of US production costs to global production costs. In the long run, that would result in 2020 Brent prices falling to $40 per barrel, Goldman analysts added. The positive impact of BTA on US producers would be similar to that on the country\u2019s refiners, giving them higher returns. On the campaign trail, US President Donald Trump pledged to lower the corporate tax rate to just 15 percent, encouraging the world\u2019s corporate titans to create jobs and build factories in the US. He has threatened German car manufacturers with a 35 percent tax on vehicles imported to the US market.

Recession?", "body": "The world has come a long way since the heady days before the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Technology, for one thing, has meant vast changes to our way of life and indeed to significant improvements in our economic productivity. Indeed, it is sometimes argued that these technological advances now make us depression-proof. Of course, the same line of reasoning \u2014\u00a0vast improvements in technology over successive decades making the world immune to massive slumps \u2014\u00a0could have been made before the 1930s. Yet a more careful analysis would reveal that the real issue in examining whether economies are prone to significant downturns are not related to technology but rather to the allocation or misallocation of resources. The employment of resources contrary to the wishes of individuals in the marketplace leads to what we commonly call a loss. One of the major factors contributing to such misdirection and losses is the falsification of price signals consequent upon the loose monetary policies of central banks, amplified by the lending policies of the commercial banks. Persistent falsification of price signals leads over time to a production structure that, although very sophisticated technologically, is nevertheless in defiance of the wishes of consumers and highly vulnerable to what economists like to call \u201cshocks\u201d. Consequently, when central banks reverse their monetary pumping (indeed one of the nastiest of \u201cshocks\u201d) and many activities that had arisen based on false price signals begin to contract, a movement back toward a less distorted production structure begins and therewith comes a retrenchment of these \u201cartificial\u201d economic activities. This liquidation of artificial structures is what recession or depression is actually achieving. This is not to impart some normative status to such contractions but rather to explain what is actually happening. The severity of a recession varies in direct proportion to the magnitude of the misallocation of resources occasioned by the activities of the central and commercial banks. Further, it is not technological innovation as such that increase people\u2019s living standards but rather an increase in capital goods per capita. This in turn is determined by the allocation of real wealth toward the expansion and the enhancement of various items of plant and equipment. This new plant and equipment will embody new technology. Again,\u00a0it is the allocation of real wealth towards the formation of new tools and machinery, which is the key to the expansion in the pool of real wealth \u2013 the increase in people\u2019s living standards. If the limiting factor, as far as economic growth is concerned, were technological know-how, then most third world economies could resolve their economic difficulties quite easily by adopting the latest western technology using their developing skills base. The main reason this has not occurred is not the lack of knowledge of the latest technology, but rather the scarcity of real wealth to fund the infrastructure necessary to be able to absorb and deploy such sophisticated plant and equipment. Yet, in order to expand real wealth production one needs investment in infrastructure, plant and equipment, but the latter investment can only take place when there is sufficient real wealth to begin with \u2013 a rather unfortunate vicious circle. What is required to break this vicious circle is to start the process of real wealth formation. This can be achieved by introducing more freedom in markets by by shrinking government and removing the central bank. I suggest that this will provide more real wealth in the hands of the private sector, which will start the process of wealth generation. In the case of developing and underdeveloped economies, improvements can also come through\u00a0the introduction and the implementation of individual and property rights \u2013 the key factor in the process of wealth accumulation. According to Mises (Human Action p 500), The eminence of the Western nations consisted in the fact that they succeeded better in checking the spirit of predatory militarism than the rest of mankind and that they thus brought forth the social institutions required for saving and investment on a broader scale. Even Marx did not contest the fact that private initiative and private ownership of the means of production were indispensable stages in the progress from primitive man\u2019s penury to the more satisfactory conditions of nineteenth-century Western Europe and North America\u2026\u2026..The legal guarantees effectively protecting the individual against expropriation and confiscation were the foundations upon which the unprecedented economic progress of the West came into flower. Mises further suggests, Investment and lending abroad are only possible if the receiving nations are unconditionally and sincerely committed to the principle of private property and do not plan to expropriate the foreign capitalist at a later date.\n", "author_name": "Mises.org", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

\u201cFree Trade\u201d", "body": "NPR featured an unintentionally funny piece this morning on Donald Trump\u2019s views toward the EU and free trade. The guest, former US ambassador to the EU Anthony Gardner, rightfully criticized the president\u2019s view that \u201cprotection will lead to great prosperity and strength,\u201d and called for continued global engagement by US companies and consumers.\u00a0But he revealed, perhaps inadvertently, what political actors mean by \u201cfree trade.\u201d Specifically, Gardner expressed great skepticism towards the prospect of the US striking a bilateral free-trade deal with the UK, supposedly one of Trump\u2019s top objectives in his upcoming meeting with new Prime Minister Theresa May. Free-trade agreements are complex, Gardner informed us, and negotiating one will be neither easy nor quick. Why? To economists, free trade means the absence of government interference with trade: no tariffs, quotas, subsidies, or other interventions, explicit or implicit. To politicians, \u201cfree-trade\u201d means a complex set of managed trade policies (Gardner even referred to the solemn obligation to \u201cwrite\u00a0the rules for global trade,\u201d which in his mind is something either our government does or a foreign government does). Which imports will be taxed, and at what rates? Which exports will be subsidized, and at what levels? How will labor, environmental, and social policies be enforced by domestic and foreign governments? For government officials, countries are engaged in \u201cfree trade\u201d when they agree on a complex package of explicit and implicit taxes and subsidies such that neither has a special advantage over the other, nor is disadvantaged relative to some other trading partner (however such advantages are defined). As Murray Rothbard once wrote, \u201cIf authentic free trade ever looms on the policy horizon, there\u2019ll be one sure way to tell. The government/media/big-business complex will oppose it tooth and nail. We\u2019ll see a string of op-eds \u201cwarning\u201d about the imminent return of the 19th century. Media pundits and academics will raise all the old canards against the free market, that it\u2019s exploitative and anarchic without government \u201ccoordination.\u201d The establishment would react to instituting true free trade about as enthusiastically as it would to repealing the income tax.\u201d \u201cIn truth,\u201d as Rothbard noted,\u00a0\u201cthe bipartisan establishment\u2019s trumpeting of \u2018free trade\u2019\u00a0since World War II fosters the opposite of genuine freedom of exchange.\u201d The Bretton Woods organizations (the World Bank and IMF) and modern trade agreements are based on the mercantilist ideas that exports make a country wealthy, imports make it poorer. (Indeed, Gardner in the interview above worried specifically that a collapse of the EU would make it harder for US manufacturers to sell their goods in Europe, but said nothing about the advantages to US and European consumers of a reduced supra-national government). That\u2019s why governments have little interest in genuine free trade. About fifteen years ago I was part of a\u00a0delegation of US officials on a fact-finding mission to Singapore, in advance of a potential US-Singapore bilateral free-trade agreement. (We all have skeletons in our closets.) One of our tasks was to interview US businesspeople operating in Singapore to see if they thought the Singaporean government was unfairly subsidizing local companies at their expense. The idea was to use this as a bargaining chip: \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop subsidizing your domestic manufacturers, we won\u2019t stop subsidizing ours.\u201d (Turns out the Singaporean government wasn\u2019t doing much to help its own companies, so the point became moot.) It didn\u2019t seem to occur to anyone that, even if the Singaporean government were protecting its own firms, at the expense of its own consumers, the US would not be better off by subsidizing its own exports to Singapore, as mercantilist theory claims. The idea that the US should simply refrain from interfering in peaceful exchanges between US-based and Singapore-based entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers \u2014 i.e., support for free trade \u2014 was simply too crazy to contemplate.\n", "author_name": "Mises.org", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

Obama issued more midnight regulatory costs during his lame-duck period, $21.7 billion, than any president in history. \u201cThe costs of these $890 billion in burdens must be borne by someone and it is the American people who inevitably end up paying for these rules in some form,\u201d said the report, authored by\u00a0AAF\u00a0regulatory policy director Sam Batkins. Over one-third of the Obama era regulations came from the Environmental Protection Agency, the study found, noting that the Departments of Energy and Health and Human Services also issued large percentages of the $890 billion total.

Res. 40, a joint resolution to revoke the Social Security gun ban enacted by the Obama administration on December 19. USA Today reports that the vote to revoke the ban was 253-180, and was \u201clargely along party lines.\u201d Breitbart News previously reported: The Social Security gun ban began to be fashioned behind closed doors in the summer of 2015 and was finalized just before Christmas 2016. It\u00a0allows the Social Security Administration (SSA) to bar certain beneficiaries from buying guns based on a need for help in managing their finances. Beneficiaries catch the SSA\u2019s attention by having their checks sent to a third party for management and this results in an investigation into the mental status of the Social Security recipient. That investigation can result in a SSA ruling that certain beneficiaries are mentally defunct, thereby barring them from from firearm purchases.\u00a0 Read more", "author_name": "Breitbart", "links":

Received $27 Billion From Feds Each Year", "body": "Sanctuary cities receive over $27 billion each year from the federal government, giving President Donald Trump significant leverage over cities such as New York and San Francisco to enforce immigration law, according to a new report. OpenTheBooks.com identified 106 sanctuary cities in the United States in their oversight report, released Friday. In all, cities that ignore federal law by harboring illegal immigrants are receiving $27.741 billion in grants and direct payments in fiscal year 2016. Twenty-two percent of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States live in just 12 American cities, according to the report. Those cities, which include New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, received $15.983 billion in federal funds. \u201cOn average, the cost of lost federal funding for a family of four residing in one of the 106 sanctuary cities is $1,810\u2014or $454 per person,\u201d OpenTheBooks.com said. \u201cA total population of 46.2 million residents live in the 106 sanctuary cities according to census

\u2018totally destroy\u2019 Johnson Amendment that Stops Churches Funding Political Parties", "body": "President Donald Trump has announced he will \u201cget rid of and totally destroy\u201d a 60-year-old rule that blocks tax-exempt religious groups from endorsing or opposing political candidates. The so-called Johnson amendment was introduced by then-Senator Lyndon B Johnson in 1954. It threatens churches and other religious institutions with the loss of their tax-exempt status should they overstep the mark. At the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington DC on Thursday Mr Trump said: \u201cJefferson asked, \u2018Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\u2019 Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs. That is why I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution\u2014I will do that.\u201d Mr Trump also spoke about a global threat to free worship. He said: \u201cFreedom of religion is a sacred right, but it\u2019s also a right under threat all around us and the world is under serious, serious threat in so many different ways.

Worthy to Succeed Scalia", "body": "Judge Andrew Napolitano delivered a glowing review of Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee to fill the seat on the Supreme Court vacated by the late Justice Scalia.  In an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight immediately following the formal White House announcement, Napolitano, who provided informal council for the President during the decision making process, opened the interview with great enthusiasm. \u201cWell I\u2019m ecstatic over this,\u201d began Napolitano. \u201cHe is probably the most worthy jurist in the country to fill the shoes of Antonin Scalia for a couple of reasons: one is a healthy skepticism about the ability of the government to regulate the economy and to regulate our personal lives.\u201d \u201cJudge Gorsuch embraces the idea of originalism, which simply means that the meaning of the Constitution was fixed at the time it was ratified, and it\u2019s only been changed each time it was amended 27 times,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s going to be changed again, the states have to amend it \u2013 the Court can\u2019t amend it.\u201d \u201cSo, it\u2019s not what Justice Ginsberg thinks it is \u2013 \u2018a living, breathing document that changes when the politicians need the change.\u201d Carlson then raised the issue that many are pondering regarding President Trump\u2019s wielding of the powers of the Executive Branch, versus the approach of his predecessors, as Obama issued many executive orders and Trump is doing the same. Napolitano drew a clear distinction between the two cases, explaining that legal executive orders cannot effectively make or alter the law, but they can direct how the law should be enforced. \u201cWhen Barack Obama issued a series of executive orders \u2013 it was actually 24 of them, affecting immigration \u2013 a trial judge in Texas ruled: \u2018This is not the President telling the Department of Homeland Security how to enforce the law, this is the President changing the law in a way that the Congress specifically rejected.\u201d \u201cWhat President Trump is doing, so far,\u201d he went on. \u201cNot only is it everything he promised he would be doing, but within the contours of the law, telling the people who work for him in the Executive Branch how he wants them to exercise their discretion.\u201d Judge Napolitano proceeded to explain the importance of Judge Gorsuch being approved by the Senate in a timely manner, as multiple landmark cases are to be heard by the Supreme Court, starting in April. One of these cases affects virtually all public schools in the United States, and whether or not the federal government will be able to force them into new \u2018transgender bathroom\u2019 policies and the necessary measures required to implement them. Others include a case relating to the First Amendment and religious freedom, and also up to four cases involving possible overreaches by the Environmental Protection Agency. Senate Democrats, led by Charles Schumer, have planned to do everything in their power to block President Trump\u2019s nominee \u2013 even prior to knowing who it would be \u2013 but there are signs that they may be reconsidering this approach.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview Tuesday that \u201call procedural options are on the table\u201d when it comes to confirming a strong conservative to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court.

The bottom line is we will confirm a strong conservative to replace Justice Scalia.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will oppose any nominee outside the mainstream. He will likely decide whether to try to lead an effort to block, or filibuster, based on the nominee\u2019s performance in confirmation hearings and feedback from his Democratic caucus, including the 10 senators who are up for re-election in states that Trump won last year.

Record in Supreme Court in Modern History", "body": "President Barack Obama had the worst record before the Supreme Court in modern history, losing half of the cases argued before the High Court in his two terms, according to a new study. While liberals point to legalizing same-sex marriage and the upholding of Obamacare subsidies as cementing the former president\u2019s legacy, the study reveals Obama had a much weaker record with the Supreme Court than previous presidents. The academic study written by Washington University professor Lee Epstein and University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner found Obama had the \u201cworst record of any President\u201d since Franklin D. Roosevelt. In fact, his presidential performance before the Supreme Court \u201cmay be the worst since the Zachary Taylor administration\u201d in the 19th century. \u201cTo assess presidential performance in the U.S. Supreme Court, we created a dataset of cases of concern to the president,\u201d Epstein and Posner wrote. \u201cThe dataset covers Presidents Franklin D.

The move will apply pressure to sanctuary cities: Local residents may be outraged when they learn that the gang member, drug trafficker, or the drunk driver that ruined lives is an illegal alien.

Syrian refugees who may have slipped through vetting lapse", "body": "Federal agents are reinvestigating the backgrounds of dozens of Syrian refugees already in the United States after discovering a lapse in vetting that allowed some who had potentially negative information in their files to enter the country, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. Agents have not concluded that any of the refugees should have been rejected for entry, but the apparent glitch \u2014 which was discovered in late 2015 and corrected last year \u2014 prevented U.S. officials who conducted background checks on the refugees from learning about possible \u201cderogatory\u201d information about them, the two officials said. At a minimum, the intelligence would have triggered further investigation that could have led some asylum applications to be rejected. The refugees whose cases are under review include one who failed a polygraph test when he applied to work at a U.S. military installation overseas and another who may have been in communication with an Islamic State leader, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.

The ruling is the latest in Chicago\u2019s fight with federal courts over the issue of allowing gun ranges within city limits.

Those under 18 were also barred from being able to enter any range within city limits. The same plaintiffs who defeated the city in 2011 then filed a new suit against the city claiming the restrictions were unconstitutional. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed on Wednesday, striking down all three restrictions in question.

With Fire, I Won\u2019t Be As Kind As Obama\u2019", "body": "US President Donald Trump has tweeted that \u201cIran is playing with fire,\u201d and warned Tehran that he won\u2019t be as \u201ckind\u201d as former President Barack Obama. His comments come after Tehran\u2019s missile test this week. Iran is playing with fire \u2013 they don't appreciate how \"kind\" President Obama was to them. Not me! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017   It comes a day after the US president threatened Tehran that military options are \u201cnot off the table\u201d in response to the missile test. On Monday, Fox News cited US officials as saying that Iran had carried out medium-range ballistic missile tests. That was followed on Thursday by reports from CNN, NBC News and Reuters, all quoting sources, that said Washington could roll out fresh sanctions against Iran as early as Friday. Iran has confirmed that it tested the missile, and that the launch was \u201cin line\u201d with its plans. \u201cWe will not allow foreigners to interfere in our defense affairs,\u201d Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan told Tasnim news agency on Wednesday. In another tweet posted on Thursday, Trump wrote that \u201cIran was on its last legs and ready to collapse,\u201d but the US \u201cgave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion.\u201d In response to Trump\u2019s tweet , Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif also took to social media, posting a statement saying that Iran is unmoved by US threats and will never initiate war. Almost two years ago, Tehran and five world powers signed a historic deal under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Tehran asserted on Wednesday that its missile tests did not involve rockets with nuclear warheads, meaning they are not covered by the deal agreed with world powers. Zarif added that Iran is using ballistic missiles as part of its defense program.\nThe $150 billion that Trump was referring to in his Tweet was apparently the amount Iran gained access to as a result of the deal, including billions of dollars in assets unfrozen in foreign banks around the globe. With the sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked. However, the US Treasury Department estimated back in the fall that once Tehran fulfills its obligations related to the funds, it would have about $55 billion left.\n", "author_name": "RT", "links":

borders\u00a0and act as a deterrent against Russian aggression, according to\u00a0reports. The ongoing operation would see the mass movement of\u00a0200 vehicles, including 30 tanks, as well as 450 soldiers to Lithuania, which shares western and eastern borders with Russia. The mission was scheduled for completion late next month and coincides with Monday\u2019s large-scale mobilization\u00a0of thousands of U.S. soldiers and heavy weaponry to Poland, which also shares an extensive border with Russia. Last year, NATO agreed on securing greater protection against Russia\u2019s military expansion in the region. Tensions between Moscow and a number of European governments have been high since Russia annexed the neighboring\u00a0former Ukrainian territory of Crimea and began supporting\u00a0separatist rebels within Ukraine. Washington, by far NATO\u2019s biggest financial sponsor, was deeply critical of Russia\u2019s foreign policy throughout former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and pushed for a stronger Western military presence along Russia\u2019s borders in addition to placing economic sanctions on Moscow.

U.S. Funds ISIS Just Got Back from Syria: Here\u2019s What She Found", "body": "Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, the lawmaker who accused the U.S. government of funding and arming ISIS and\u00a0introduced a bill to prevent it from happening in future, recently disclosed that she\u00a0met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during her recent trip to Syria. The move has reportedly\u00a0angered many of her fellow congressmen and women.  Upon returning from the war-stricken nation, Gabbard released the following statement in the form of a press release: \u201cMy visit to Syria has made it abundantly clear: Our counterproductive regime change war does not serve America\u2019s interest, and it certainly isn\u2019t in the interest of the Syrian people. \u201cAs I visited with people from across the country, and heard heartbreaking stories of how this war has devastated their lives, I was asked, \u2018Why is the United States and its allies helping al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups try to take over Syria? Syria did not attack the United States. Al-Qaeda did.\u2019 I had no answer.\u201d According to the press release, Gabbard met with refugees, Syrian opposition leaders who led protesters in 2011, widows and family members who fight alongside al-Qaeda groups, pro-Assad troops, humanitarian workers, and students, to name a few. Gabbard also met with high-ranking officials such as Lebanon\u2019s newly-elected President Aon and Prime Minister Hariri, as well as U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard, Syrian President Assad, Grand Mufti Hassoun, and Archbishop Denys Antoine Chahda of the Syrian Catholic Church of Aleppo. Initially, Gabbard allegedly had no intention of meeting Assad, as she stated in an\u00a0interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.  \u201cWhen the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it\u2019s important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we\u2019ve got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,\u201d she told Tapper. The meeting with Assad is incredibly controversial because of\u00a0numerous allegations by the U.N. that Assad has committed crimes against humanity. \u201cWhatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria,\u201d she added. \u201cIn order for any peace agreement, in order for any possibility of a viable peace agreement to occur there has to be a conversation with him.\u201d Not surprisingly, the media has hyped up this visit as outrageous but has omitted some very glaring hypocrisies that arise as a result of Gabbard\u2019s trip to Syria. First, the\u00a0Obama administration and\u00a0Bush administration both drew serious allegations of war crimes, but if Gabbard had met with either of those former presidents, it\u2019s doubtful anyone would have batted an eyelid. Second, former Secretary of State John Kerry\u00a0met with Assad in 2009, even though, after nine years in office, Assad was clearly\u00a0responsible for all of the things western media has been relentlessly accusing him of\u00a0doing since 2011. Third, Gabbard\u2019s meeting symbolizes the ridiculousness of America\u2019s foreign policy decision-making system. A few hundred old men and women who have never been to Syria \u2014 nor care to go \u2014 sit in a room and deliberate a piece of paper deciding whether or not to drop million dollar tomahawk missiles on a relatively poor country. Even when\u00a0these decision-makers are well aware of the horror their edicts will unleash, they are never required to visit the country, talk to its people, or understand the situation and better educate themselves. In the case of Syria, Congress wasn\u2019t even required to approve the air campaign that began in 2014, as Obama authorized airstrikes without their approval anyway. Gabbard\u2019s move should be applauded \u2014 not ridiculed. Singling Assad out as some sort of mass-murdering psychopath while foreign leaders routinely meet with alleged war criminals such as Israel\u2019s\u00a0Binyamin Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia\u2019s leadership, and\u00a0Henry Kissinger, to name a few, is the epitome of U.S.-NATO arrogance. Gabbard may have met with a mass murderer, but she also met with numerous people on the ground \u2014 the people who matter most. After doing so, she concluded: \u201cI return to Washington, DC with even greater resolve to end our illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government. I call upon Congress and the new Administration to answer the pleas of the Syrian people immediately and support the Stop Arming Terrorists Act. We must stop directly and indirectly supporting terrorists\u2014directly by providing weapons, training and logistical support to rebel groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and ISIS; and indirectly through Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Turkey, who, in turn, support these terrorist groups. We must end our war to overthrow the Syrian government and focus our attention on defeating al-Qaeda and ISIS.\u201d No one can criticize her strategy because, for the last six years, no one has even attempted it.\n", "author_name": "Anti Media", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/", "http://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerickJones",

Looks as If the World Is Preparing for War\u2019", "body": "The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists\u00a0announced on Thursday of this week that the Doomsday Clock now stands at two-and-a-half minutes to midnight. This spine-tingling announcement suggests that existential threats now pose a greater threat to humanity than they have at any time since the height of the Cold War. \u201cThis is the closest to midnight the Doomsday Clock has ever been in the lifetime of almost everyone in this room. It\u2019s been 64 years since it was closer,\u201d said Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist at Arizona State University and the chair of the Bulletin\u2019s board of sponsors. Now is the time to panic \u2014 or not, depending on your level of resolve (or apathy). Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the Soviet Union and author of The New Russia, wrote an article published in TIME Magazine\u00a0entitled \u201cIt All Looks as if the World Is Preparing For War.\u201d In the article, Gorbachev notes: \u201cToday, however, the nuclear threat once again seems real. Relations between the great powers have been going from bad to worse for several years now. The advocates for arms build-up and the military-industrial complex are rubbing their hands.\u201d Gorbachev is not overstating the threat of global warfare. In an\u00a0interview with Prism magazine, retired Army General Stanley McChrystal issued two warnings that, as\u00a0noted by Foreign Policy magazine, are \u201chair-raising\u201d to say the least. \u201cA European war is not unthinkable,\u201d McChrystal explained. \u201cPeople who want to believe that a war in Europe is not possible might be in for a surprise. We have to acknowledge great power politics; we can\u2019t pretend that they are gone.\u201d McChrystal admits the U.S. made vital mistakes in speedily invading Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as \u201cpaying a high price\u201d in Syria. As he has observed: \u201cIn the case of Afghanistan, immediately after 9/11, in terms of military action we should have done nothing initially. I now believe we should have taken the first year after 9/11 and sent 10,000 young Americans\u2014military, civilians, diplomats\u2014to language school; Pashtu, Dari, Arabic. We should have started to build up the capacity we didn\u2019t have. I would have spent that year with diplomats traveling the world as the aggrieved party,\u201d McChrystal stated. Now that the world is headed down the path toward a possible world war, McChrystal acknowledges the unthinkable is to follow: the erosion of our civil liberties, which will directly impact on ordinary civilians. \u201cWe are beginning an era in which our ability to leverage technology to track people and control populations is going to create a lot of tension; I think we are going to see a lot more population control measures. We are going to have to give up a lot more of our precious civil rights than most of us imagine because we want security,\u201d McChrystal added. Speaking to Republican policymakers in Philadelphia, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May\u00a0stated that Britain and the U.S. will no longer invade sovereign foreign nations \u201cin an attempt to make the world in their own image.\u201d Such an ambiguous statement makes it unclear whether this means Britain and the U.S. will still invade sovereign nations for other reasons, especially in light of May\u2019s statement that \u201cnor can we afford to stand idly by when the threat is real and when it is in our own interests to intervene.\u201d What May\u2019s address really symbolizes is that the U.K. will still continue to follow the U.S. hand-in-hand, as has been the\u00a0case for decades. This can be seen most clearly in the events following Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0calls to focus more on ISIS as opposed to Assad in Syria. Britain\u2019s answer to Donald Trump in the form of Foreign Minister Boris Johnson followed suit, stating it is \u201cbetter sometimes to have a tyrant than not to have a ruler at all.\u201d Not surprisingly, as a result of her comments and commitment to the U.S.-U.K alliance, May just secured \u201c100% support\u201d for NATO from President Trump. Instead of focusing on Assad in Syria, as Obama and former prime minister, David Cameron did, May made it clear the U.K. and U.S.\u2019 renewed focus is on this recently adopted approach to foreign policy:\u00a0Iran. May stated that pushing back on \u201cIran\u2019s aggressive efforts\u201d to increase its \u201carc of influence from Tehran through to the Mediterranean\u201d was a \u201cpriority.\u201d Essentially, despite May\u2019s rhetoric, nothing will actually change in practice. War is still a reality; it just might take place in a different theater. As a result, it is no surprise that the\u00a0U.K. and the U.S. have been the most staunch backers of the Saudi-led brutal assault on Yemen, as it is argued a Houthi-led government in Yemen could\u00a0align itself with Iran, creating an Iranian-influenced adversary on Riyadh\u2019s doorstep. It should also be noted that Iran is bound to Syria by a\u00a0mutual defense agreement. Russia and China have made it abundantly clear they will not tolerate any attack on Syria or Iran, as evidenced by Russia\u2019s decision to overtly intervene in the Syrian war in 2015. Further, Iran may eventually join the Eurasian security bloc, placing the Islamic Republic into a direct alliance with nuclear powers Russia and China. In turn, the U.K. and the U.S. are\u00a0surrounding Russia with troops, missiles, tanks, and everything in between. Does this sound like the actions of two countries that will no longer invade sovereign nations to shape the world in their image? There is no way around this delicate issue other than to completely dismantle the world\u2019s current system of war. As\u00a0noted by Forbes: \u201cHowever, there is more to averting nuclear holocaust than having a robust strategic force. The U.S. needs to avoid getting into non-nuclear conflicts and crises that could escalate to the nuclear level. Eastern Europe is the place where such a scenario is most likely to unfold, because since the Cold War ended, the U.S. has extended security guarantees to former Soviet republics and satellites that lie close to the Russian heartland.\u201d Gorbachev himself has acknowledged this chilling fact and offered his vast experience in this area. The whole world should heed his words: \u201cIn modern world, wars must be outlawed, because none of the global problems we are facing can be resolved by war \u2014 not poverty, nor the environment, migration, population growth, or shortages of resources.\u201d [emphasis added]\n", "author_name": "Anti Media", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

Countries Trump Banned \u2013 Media Didn\u2019t Care", "body": "While the lying media is freaking out over President Trump\u2019s travel ban for seven Middle Eastern countries deemed security risks, they didn\u2019t give a damn about Obama bombing them. Though the media is currently in a tizzy because Trump\u2019s executive order held up around 300 people at airports, Obama\u2019s bombings were reported as completely reasonable to bring about peace. Out of the seven countries that were banned by President Trump last Friday, five were bombed by the Obama administration: Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya and Somalia. Where were the George Soros funded organizations protesting the \u201cnearly 100 attacks\u201d that have occurred since 2009 in Yemen \u201cresulting in the deaths of hundreds of militants, but also many civilians?\u201d Did Chuck Schumer shed a tear for the 62 Syrian troops killed and 100 more wounded that the Obama administration \u201caccidentally bombed\u201d in 2016?  Did Schumer openly weep when the Obama administration was \u201cduped into attacking Somali troops\u201d and killed 22 of them in an air strike late last year? It\u2019s fine for the Nobel Peace Prize winning President to bomb these people in their own countries, but for President Trump to temporarily prevent them from traveling to our country to keep America safe is \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d ", "author_name": "Information Liberation", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

but would like to fight ISIS with Putin", "body": "US President Donald Trump hopes to have a good relationship with Russia to fight the \u201cevil\u201d Islamic State, he told reporters after meeting UK Prime Minister Theresa May. She said the US is committed to NATO and the special relationship with Britain. Among the topics of the discussion, May said, were fighting Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL or Daesh), and dealing with Syria and Russia. The PM extended Trump the official invitation from the queen to visit the UK later this year. Trump \u201cconfirmed he\u2019s 100 percent behind NATO,\u201d May told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump told a reporter asking about the topics of Saturday\u2019s scheduled talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally.\u201d \u201cWe believe the sanctions should continue until we see the Minsk agreement fully implemented,\u201d May said. Further pressed about his possible policy on Russia, Trump said, that IS is an \u201cevil that has to be stopped,\u201d and that he hoped to do so together with Moscow. \u201cI will be representing the American people very strongly\u201d in talks with Putin, Trump said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get along very well,\u201d Trump told a British reporter skeptical of his talks with May. He also pointed out that he foresaw the victory of Brexit last year. \u201cI think Brexit\u2019s going to be a wonderful thing for your country.\u201d While repeating his personal belief that interrogation tactics like waterboarding \u2013 widely denounced as torture and banned under current US laws \u2013 are effective, Trump said his Defense Secretary James Mattis is categorically opposed to them. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree, but I would tell you that he will override [me] because I\u2019m giving him that power,\u201d Trump said of Mattis, who was granted a special waiver by Congress in order to become the civilian leader of the US military, because he retired in 2013 and would otherwise not be eligible.\n", "author_name": "RT", "links": ["#content", "/",

\u201cKnock the Hell Out of ISIS Together\u201d", "body": "In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump said it would be to the advantage of both Russia and the US to mend ties and pool their efforts in the fight against terrorism. Speaking to Sean Hannity of Fox News, US President Donald Trump said that he looks forward to speaking with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. \u201cHe called me after I won, but I haven\u2019t had a discussion, but I understand we will be having a discussion soon,\u201d Trump told Hannity. On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Trump and Putin will have a phone conversation on Saturday. Trump again reiterated his intention to pursue good relations with Russia, pointing out that it would be mutually beneficial and would allow both sides to step up the fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL). \u201cI don\u2019t know Putin, but if we can get along with Russia that\u2019s a great thing, it\u2019s good for Russia, it\u2019s good for us, we go out together and knock the hell out of ISIS, because that\u2019s a real sickness,\u201d he said. Trump has repeatedly spoken of his desire to mend relations with Russia, not excluding the possibility of lifting the sanctions against Russia in the future, depending on its contribution to fight against terrorism and cooperation on other issues, like curbing nuclear proliferation. \u201cIf you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody\u2019s doing some really great things?\u201d he said in a recent interview to the Wall Street Journal, saying that he did not see any problem in holding a meeting with Putin. \u201cI understand that they would like to meet, and that\u2019s absolutely fine with me,\u201d he said. Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov\u00a0said the much-anticipated meeting between Putin and Trump is a matter of months rather than weeks. \u201cIt won\u2019t happens in a matter of weeks. Let\u2019s hope that it can happen in months to come,\u201d Peskov told BBC, adding that \u201cPutin will be ready\u201d for the meeting whenever it occurs. \n", "author_name": "RT", "links":

for reelection, marking shift in Syria policy", "body": "UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says Britain has changed its stance and now believes Syrian President Bashar Assad could potentially be allowed to run for president if there was a peaceful settlement of the conflict. \u201cIt is our view that Bashar al-Assad should go, it\u2019s been our longstanding position. But we are open-minded about how that happens and the timescale on which that happens,\u201d Johnson told the Lords International Relations Committee on Thursday, according to The Guardian. The statement came a day before British Prime Minister Theresa May meets with recently inaugurated US President Donald Trump in Washington, which means all sides interested in peaceful settlement of the long-lasting conflict in Syria could reconsider their views on the matter. There is a need to be \u201crealistic about the way the landscape has changed\u201d and to take a fresh look at the situation, Johnson said. \u201cWe are getting to the stage where some sort of democratic resolution has got to be introduced,\u201d he added. \u201cI would hope it would be possible to have a plebiscite or an election which is properly supervised by the UN and in which all the 11 million displaced persons, including the 4 million who are outside Syria now, are fully entitled to vote,\u201d he said. Among most important points on today\u2019s agenda, Johnson named a clear understanding of \u201cwhere the White House is coming from.\u201d \u201cWe need to understand how they see the endgame here, and we need to help shape that conversation, and some of the reservations we have, particularly about Iran,\u201d he said. Johnson stressed that cooperation with Russia would most certainly mean cooperation with Iran, Syria\u2019s ally, which is likely to be \u201ca good thing.\u201d \u201cWe think that trying to improve relations with Iran through this deal, and it\u2019s a pretty cautious thing, is on the whole a good thing and we regard that as one of the achievements of the (former US President Barack) Obama administration.\u201d On the other hand, the foreign minister said that they \u201cdo not want to see is a further extension of Iranian policy and influence in the region.\u201d Johnson has not excluded the possibility of cooperation with Moscow. \u201cIf there is a possibility of an arrangement with the Russians that simultaneously allows Assad to move towards the exit and diminishes Iranian influence in the region by getting rid of Assad and allows us to join with the Russians in attacking Daesh (IS) and wiping them off the face of the Earth\u2026 then that might be a way forward,\u201d he said. The UK has long stuck to a different position regarding Syria\u2019s president, unambiguously stating that he \u201cmust go.\u201d The same position has been repeated by the US and its allies which back the Syrian opposition and armed groups since the very beginning of the conflict. In July 2016, newly appointed Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson argued that \u201cthe suffering of the Syrian people will not end while Assad remains in power,\u201d adding that he could stay only for

Releases Disturbing Report on US-Backed War in Yemen", "body": "Human Rights Watch (HRW) has\u00a0released its 2017 World Report on the current conflict in Yemen, and the latest update paints a very disturbing picture of the U.S.- and U.K.- backed war of aggression the Saudis are currently waging. The report makes clear the depth of U.S. and U.K. support for the current war in Yemen, the\u00a0poorest country in the Middle East, as well as the potential legal ramifications of this support \u2014 something the rights group has previously\u00a0warned about. Between the eruption of the Saudi-led bombardment in March 2015 and October of last year, the report explains, the U.N. documented the deaths of at least 4,125 civilians. A majority of those deaths were caused by the coalition. Further, the U.N. recently came forward stating over 10,000 civilians have been killed in the war to date, with 40,000 others wounded. This is a \u201clow estimate,\u201d \u00a0and the U.N. figure does not include deaths recorded by hospitals and health centers. The report confirms that the coalition has used\u00a0internationally banned cluster munitions and deployed countless air strikes that have indiscriminately or disproportionately killed and wounded thousands of civilians. Most surprising is that although HRW receives a\u00a0large amount of funding from Saudi Arabia, the HRW report has not bought into the official Saudi-U.S. narrative that Iran is behind the current war in Yemen. Instead, the report fails to so much as even mention Iran. The opening statement reads: \u201cThe Saudi Arabia-led coalition\u2019s aerial and ground campaign against Houthi forces and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh continued in 2016.\u201d In doing so, HRW has pinpointed the current cause of the conflict besieging Yemen: former president Saleh still retains the loyalty of the armed forces, who fight alongside the Houthi rebels. In essence, the Saudis are attempting to bomb the will of the people into accepting a leader they already ousted. The HRW report continues: \u201cHuman Rights Watch has documented 58 apparently unlawful coalition airstrikes since the start of the campaign, which have killed nearly 800 civilians and hit homes, markets, hospitals, schools, civilian businesses, and mosques. Some attacks may amount to war crimes. These include airstrikes on a crowded market in northern Yemen on March 15 that killed 97 civilians, including 25 children, and another on a crowded funeral in Sanaa on October that killed over 100 civilians and wounded hundreds more.\u201d [emphasis added] As Anti-Media\u00a0previously\u00a0reported, the U.S.-backed coalition is intentionally starving Yemen\u2019s inhabitants. The HRW report confirms Saudi Arabia\u2019s intentions to destroy the basic livelihood of Yemen\u2019s civilian population: \u201cRepeated coalition airstrikes on factories and other civilian economic structures raise serious concerns that the coalition deliberately sought to inflict damage to Yemen\u2019s limited production capacity. Human Rights Watch investigated 18 apparently unlawful strikes, some of which used US or UK-supplied weapons, on 14 civilian economic sites. The strikes killed 130 civilians and wounded 173 more. Following the attacks, many of the factories ended production and hundreds of workers lost their livelihoods.\u201d The report also outlines the use of cluster bombs, indiscriminate attacks, deliberate Saudi air raids on health facilities\u00a0and avenues for humanitarian access, the Houthis\u2019 use of children in the war, and the key international actors in the conflict (remember, Iran is not even mentioned), to name a few. Generally speaking, the war in Yemen receives very little media coverage in Western nations. As such, it has hardly been recognized as an issue in the much-anticipated transition from an Obama presidency to a Trump presidency. Under peace prize-winning President Obama, the U.S. made over $115 billion in arms sales to the Saudi regime. It remains unclear what will happen to this war under a bomb-loving Trump administration. One thing is clear, however. The war in Yemen would be over tomorrow if the U.S.\u00a0withdrew its support for the brutal Saudi-led campaign.\n", "author_name": "Anti Media", "links": ["#content", "/",

Combat With 276 Deficiencies and Counting", "body": "The F-35 stealth fighter jet suffers from hundreds of problems and won\u2019t be fully combat-capable before 2020, says a scathing report from the Pentagon\u2019s top evaluator. New issues keep cropping up, and fixing them all may cost over $1 billion. Dr. Michael Gilmore\u2019s damning assessment is part of the massive annual report\u00a0for fiscal year 2016, and his 62-page dossier\u00a0devoted to the F-35 paints a grim picture of America\u2019s much touted, futuristic Joint Strike Fighter. The program, which began in 2001, was supposed to deliver a fifth-generation jet serving the needs of the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps, achieving savings through a modular design. Instead, it is 70 percent over initial cost estimates and years behind schedule. Dr. Gilmore, the Pentagon\u2019s director of operational test & evaluation (OTE) under President Barack Obama, is leaving the Department of Defense as part of the regular change in politically appointed officials. Though F-35 officials have continued to insist the jet is doing just fine and that the problems found in operational testing were being fixed rapidly, Gilmore\u2019s final report makes it clear that he doesn\u2019t believe their reassurances. \u201cThe Services have designated 276 deficiencies in combat performance as \u2018critical to correct\u2019 in Block 3F, but less than half of the critical deficiencies were addressed with attempted corrections,\u201d says Gilmore\u2019s report, referring to problems in the F-35\u2019s software. \u201cDeficiencies continue to be discovered at a rate of about 20 per month,\u201d the report added. \u201cMuch more testing is needed to assess the cybersecurity structure of the air vehicle and supporting logistics infrastructure system,\u201d the report says, \u201cand to determine whether, and to what extent, vulnerabilities may have led to compromises of F-35 data.\u201d Worse yet, the program is trying to skip many of the tests and declare the systems development phase over early, shifting the testing to the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) process starting in August 2017, the report noted. Rushing the tests means shifting the risks onto operational testing, follow-on modernization, and to the pilots intended to fly the planes into combat. The F-35 program office \u201chas no plan to adequately fix and verify hundreds of these deficiencies using flight testing within its currently planned schedule and resources,\u201d Gilmore wrote. \u201cMultiple problems and delays make it clear that the program will not be able to start IOT&E with full combat capability until late CY18 or early CY19, at the soonest,\u201d meaning 2018 and 2019, respectively. Finalizing the systems development phase would cost around $500 million, Gilmore noted, adding that the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office\u2019s estimate ranged up to $1.125 billion. In addition to software trouble, the jet is plagued by structural problems. For example, the connection between the vertical tail and the airframe is wearing out much faster than expected, while arresting hooks are fraying after only one use. Engine nacelles are overheating under certain flight tests, horizontal tail continues to suffer heat damage, and the \u201cexcessive, violent\u201d oscillations during catapult launches of the naval F-35C version present a safety concern for pilots. Tests of the pilot escape system showed a risk of serious neck injury or death for pilots weighing less than 136 pounds (61kg), who remain restricted from flying the F-35. On the maintenance side, technicians are required to physically connect the Portable Maintenance Aid (PMA) laptops to the aircraft in order to conduct most activities. If the PMA fails to connect to the aircraft properly and technicians unplug it prematurely, the laptop cannot connect to another aircraft until it is reset by an Automatic Logistics Information System (ALIS) administrator, \u201cwhich can be a lengthy process.\u201d Given all that, the Department of Defense should consider committing to a \u201cblock buy\u201d of the jets, since in their current state the F-35 does not fit the legal requirements and the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cfly before you buy\u201d approach to purchases, Gilmore\u2019s report concluded. The F-35 is a single-seat, single-engine aircraft that comes in three versions: the F-35A for the Air Force; the F-35B for the US Marine Corps; and the F-35C for the US Navy. It is being developed by Lockheed Martin, with additional funding from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Israel and Japan have also placed orders for the jet.\n", "author_name": "RT", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

Nuke-Spotting Radar To Monitor North Korea", "body": "The Sea-based X-Band Radar has deployed out of Pearl Harbor\u00a0after North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un recently said his country was in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Media sources reported that the SBX was\u00a0being sent about 2,000 miles northwest of Hawaii\u00a0to watch for a possible North Korean launch in coming months.\u00a0The Pentagon downplayed the floating radar\u2019s Monday departure. As The Honolulu Star Advertiser reports,\u00a0dispatching the \u201cSBX\u201d out to sea sends \u201ca very clear strategic message of deterrence to the ICBM threat of the North Korean leader that has intensified since first announced on Jan. 1,\u201d\u00a0said Riki Ellison, chairman of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a Virginia-based nonprofit that advocates a strong U.S. missile defense. Media sources reported that the SBX was being sent about 2,000 miles northwest of Hawaii to watch for a possible North Korean launch in coming months. The Pentagon downplayed the floating radar\u2019s Monday departure. \u201cThe SBX\u2019s current deployment is not based on any credible threat; however, we cannot discuss specifics for this particular mission while it is underway,\u201d\u00a0Navy Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Defense Department spokesman, said in an email. Kim said in a Jan. 1 speech that North Korea was prepping for an ICBM test launch. \u201cThe SBX deployed in the Pacific Ocean enhances and boosts the probability of kill for each of the current 37 and soon to be 44 (ground-based interceptors) in both Alaska and California, if fired at a North Korean ICBM,\u201d\u00a0Ellison said Thursday in an MDAA release. The more than 280-foot-tall SBX is topped by a golf ball-like dome containing a phased array radar and is a hard-to-miss sight at its mooring off Ford Island.\u00a0The powerful radar, which is only operated at sea, acquires, tracks and discriminates the flight characteristics of ballistic missiles. The Union of Concerned Scientists reported $2.2 billion SBX is designed for long-range precision tracking and discrimination of warheads from other objects,\u00a0but it \u201chas a number of serious limitations, including a very limited electronic field of view.\u201d Based on shortcomings of the SBX,\u00a0the U.S. Missile Defense Agency announced plans to develop by 2020 a long-range discrimination radar in Alaska,\u00a0the scientific group said.\n", "author_name": "Zero Hedge", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

The state-funded study will compare opioids and medical marijuana for treating acute pain, such as that from a broken rib. That distinction\u2014acute pain from an injury\u2014is also an important one. A small body of evidence suggests that medical marijuana is effective for chronic pain, which persists even after an injury should have healed and for which opioids are already not a great treatment.

Vitamin B12 Supplement", "body": "Many people erroneously assume that vitamin B12 deficiencies are only suffered by vegans and vegetarians\u2013however those who eat any kind of diet can be at the risk\u00a0of not receiving enough, which can have a devastating impact on your body. \u00a0 One of the most important symptoms to watch out for in vitamin B12 deficiency is extreme tiredness. Those who are not receiving enough of the vitamin through their diet may find it difficult to get through they day without a nap, and it can interrupt their work or social schedule. According to the NHS, or National Health Service, in the United Kingdom, the following is a list of symptoms to look out for if you suspect you may be deficient in vitamin B12: Low levels of B12 is known as folate anemia, which causes your body to develop larger red blood cells than normal, which makes it more difficult for them to move around the body\u2013specifically doing their duty of carrying oxygen. This is similar to the more classic kind of anemia that comes from low levels of iron in the blood. So what does B12 do besides prevent these symptoms from occurring? First and foremost, the vitamin supports your nervous system. Additionally, the vitamin helps your body make DNA, nerve cells and blood cells and also supports your brain and immune system.\u00a0 You are more likely to be deficient in this vitamin if you are a vegan or vegetarian, suffer from Celiac\u2019s disease, avoid gluten or are over 50, but that doesn\u2019t mean that anyone can\u2019t suffer from it. One reason why many people don\u2019t get enough of the vitamin is because it is only present in animal products (meat, shellfish, fish, eggs, dairy, etc.). Those who avoid or cut down on them for health or ethnical reasons may find themselves without enough vitamin B12. In order to ensure you get enough of this crucial vitamin, it is generally recommended that you take a supplement, especially if you are\u00a0over the age of 50. This way, you can be sure your body is getting everything it needs to function in a healthy manner. If you feel your deficiency is severe enough, contact your doctor and he or she may provide you with an injection to raise your B12\u00a0more quickly.\u00a0\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller", "links":

Struggle To Conceive", "body": "Obese couples looking to have a baby may want to consider their waistline first, as a new study from the National Institutes of Health has revealed that when both parents are overweight, it can be incredibly difficult for them to conceive naturally.\u00a0 According to research, it may be 55% to 59% more difficult for them to have a baby compared to their thinner counterparts.\u00a0 Research into the effects of children of obese parents has been relatively popular in recent years. While it began with simply monitoring the weight of the mother and the effects on the child, scientists have also determined that the weight of the father may also play an important role in a child\u2019s development. And now, both play vital roles in conceiving a child.\u00a0 Scientists came to the conclusion after monitoring over 500 couples trying to have a baby for one year. During the study, the women kept a diary of their ovulation in addition to keeping track of when they had sex with their partner. They were also instructed to take home pregnancy tests regularly, the results of which were then recorded in their diaries. Negating other factors, it was found that overweight and obese couples had a much more difficult time getting pregnant. The results were then published in the journal\u00a0Human Reproduction.\u00a0 Lead author\u00a0Dr Rajeshwari Sundaram stated: \u201cA lot of studies on fertility and body composition have focused on the female partner, but our findings underscore the importance of including both partners. Our results also indicate that fertility specialists may want to consider couples\u2019 body compositions when counselling patients.\u201d More studies, however, are needed in order to ensure that BMI and waist circumference are actually a factor in contributing to the difficulties in getting pregnant. However, the study coincides with several other studies that have taken place that confirm it is much more difficult for a heavier woman to get pregnant than her thinner counterparts. Research has also shown that children of obese parents age more quickly and often suffer from social and developmental issues more readily than children of those who are in the appropriate weight category for their height. These are all important factors for parents-to-be to consider.\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

Rising Costs and Fewer Options for 2017", "body": "A new report shows that Obamacare enrollees could pay more money and end up with fewer options in 2017. The study from Avalere Health, a health care consulting firm, showed rising premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs for many customers, a shrinking amount of insurance options in the exchange market, and a drastically lower number of Obamacare enrollees than projected. Premiums for the silver-level plan, Obamacare\u2019s most popular option, increased by an average of 12 percent in 2017. Specifically, the Avalere report showed that 71 percent of Obamacare enrollees covered under the silver plan have seen their average costs rise from $496 per month last year to $554 per month this year. The average cost for the first and second cheapest silver-level plans have also gone up by 25 percent. Even for Obamacare\u2019s bronze-level plan\u2014the cheapest, lowest quality option\u2014the monthly, average premiums rose from $408 in 2016 to $475 this year.

It\u2019s also the site of a mysterious and deadly illness plaguing children in May and June for each of the last 22 years. Researchers now say the two facts go hand in hand. In a Lancet study, they say children who filled up on lychee and skipped dinner ended up with dangerously low blood sugar and brain inflammation due to a toxin in the fruit, reports CNN. While bodies typically metabolize fatty acids to produce glucose, the hypoglycin toxin in lychee \u201cseverely impaired\u201d a child\u2019s ability to synthesize glucose, researchers say. As a result, children experienced fever, seizures and convulsions, and would slip in and out of consciousness.

Heart Disease, Obesity and Diabetes", "body": "Recent reports have stated that the idea that it is necessary to eat breakfast has been funded by companies promoting breakfast foods\u2013however new studies show that eating breakfast can help prevent heart disease, obesity and diabetes.\u00a0 Although the idea of breakfast isn\u2019t the most important part, the American Heart Association says. Instead, it is about eating meals at regular intervals. Those who do not preplan their meals or eat every few hours often fall prey to overeating or consuming too much junk during the day. Eating breakfast can also give you a huge energy boost to help you get through your day, so the American Heart Association recommends eating more calories earlier in the day instead of saving big meals for the evening. The recent research that made the American Heart Association come to its conclusion was conducted by researchers at Columbia University and published in the journal Circulation.\u00a0 Those involved pored over studies concerning breakfast and heart disease that had already taken place. They found that those who eat breakfast everyday are less likely to develop heart disease or become obese. They are also less likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. Victoria Taylor, a dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said the following about the newfound results: \u201cIn the UK our lifestyles have become more demanding and as a result our meal patterns have become more varied and irregular. Compared with 30 years ago, more meals are skipped or eaten on the go, and later in the day. This study shows that it\u2019s not only what we eat but also when we eat it that affects our risk of heart disease.\u201d The researchers at Columbia University have also found that eating late at night can cause problems with cardiovascular health and contribute to obesity. It has also been found that with animals who are given food while they are inactive, often are at more of a risk of gaining weight. Currently, the American Heart Association and researchers at Columbia do not know exactly why meal timing affects heart health, but they do know it seems that those who eat at frequent intervals are less likely to experience problems.\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/", "http://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerickJones",

according to study of data from a Japanese lunar orbiter. A team led by Kentaro Terada of Osaka University looked at data from the Selenological and Engineering Explorer, better known as Kaguya. The researchers found that a certain kind of oxygen isotope was present in the lunar soil, an isotope that occurs on Earth. Almost all of the oxygen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere for the last 2 and a half billion years came from photosynthesis. That means the moon\u2019s rocks have been picking up small amounts of oxygen from living things on Earth; the moon is \u201ccontaminated\u201d with the waste products of plants, the researchers said.

Statistics, Death by Heart Disease On the Rise", "body": "According to the American Heart Association, death by heart disease is increasing rapidly and takes the lives of 800,000 people annually.\u00a0 The numbers are so high that the rate of those living with heart disease and heart failure is expected to rise a whopping 46% by 2030. This will basically make the issue an epidemic. The report on current statistics of heart disease, which was published in the journal Circulation, stated: \u201cCardiovascular diseases claim more lives each year than all forms of cancer and Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease combined. About 92.1 million American adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke. Direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular diseases and stroke are estimated to total more than $316 billion; that includes both health expenditures and lost productivity.\u201d Current risk factors for heart disease include obesity, physical inactivity, high cholesterol, smoking, high blood pressure and family history. It is more common in men than it is in women. While the disease is more common in men than in women, it can often be under-diagnosed in the female sex. This is particularly true when women are having a heart attack, so it is important to ensure that females are vigilant with speaking to the doctor about their symptoms. Dr. Daniel Snavely an interventional cardiologist with St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center, stated: \u201cThe most common thing we hear is women don\u2019t have typical symptoms, such as frank chest pain.\u00a0We often think of chest pain or feeling like an elephant is sitting on your chest as the symptom of a heart attack or heart pain, but women sometimes present differently. The elderly and those with diabetes also present differently.\u201d About one third of reported deaths each year in the United States are from heart disease and cardiovascular events due to the condition. This translates to approximately one person every 40 seconds. Doctors suggest that the best ways to prevent heart disease remain the controllable variables. While one may not be able to change their biological sex or family history, one can change their diet and exercise pattern. Physical activity is one of the most important aspects of keeping heart disease at bay, as is keeping your BMI in the appropriate range for your height. If you smoke, it is suggested you take steps to give that up as soon as possible.\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

And just like messy human relationships, sometimes an ex that you thought you had forgotten resurfaces unexpectedly. Happily though, today\u2019s case does not involve any mean texts or tweets, but the remains of an ancient supercontinent, the discovery of which sheds light on the tumultuous and mysterious beginnings of this planet. The ancient remains in question belong to Mauritia, which was one of the pieces that splintered from the massive supercontinent Gondwana to form a sandwich with India and Madagascar. We know that this ancient threesome eventually separated with India and Madagascar going their separate ways but whatever happened to Mauritia? For the clues to its whereabouts, one needs to look at rocks found on the present-day island of Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa. But we\u2019re not just talking about any rocks, we\u2019re looking at those containing zircon. This mineral is significant because it occurs mainly in granites from the continents and predates the formation of young volcanic islands such as Mauritius. In other words, zircon should not be found here at all \u2013 it\u2019s old and the island is young. Lead author Lewis Ashwal, a geologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa explains why: \u201cMauritius is an island, and there is no rock older than nine million years old on the island. However, by studying the rocks on the island, we have found zircons that are as old as three billion years.\u201d Read more", "author_name": "NewAtlas.com", "links": ["#content", "/",

Makes it Possible for ALS and Stroke Patients to \u201cSpeak\u201d", "body": "There are several devastating diseases that make it very difficult or even even impossible for patients to continue communicating with their loved ones\u2013however a new device has made it possible for those \u201clocked in\u201d\u00a0to communicate with their friends and family. The new device monitors patients\u2019 brain blood oxygen levels, which can help scientists effectively \u201cread their minds\u201d using technology called near-infrared spectroscopy. It goes over the person\u2019s head like a swimming cap, and its sensors can detect changes within the brain\u2019s blood levels. Those who took part in the experiment to test out the device suffer from what is known as \u201clocked-in\u201d syndrome, meaning they have lost all ability to move except for blinking one or both eyelids. When a person is unable to even move their eyelids, the syndrome is known as \u201ccomplete locked-in\u201d syndrome. This groundbreaking device was created by\u00a0Niels Birbaumer, now at the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering in Geneva. Four people with \u201clocked-in syndrome\u201d were tested to see how well the device works by asking them yes or no questions to which the answers would be obvious, such as, \u201cIs the capital of Germany Paris?\u201d They found that the device was accurate 70% of the time, which although is not perfect, is still greater than a guessing game. Birbaumer stated of the experiments: \u201cWe were initially surprised at the positive responses when we questioned the four completely locked-in patients about their quality of life. All four had accepted artificial ventilation in order to sustain their life, when breathing became impossible; thus, in a sense, they had already chosen to live. What we observed was that as long as they received satisfactory care at home, they found their quality of life acceptable. It is for this reason, if we could make this technique widely clinically available, it could have a huge impact on the day-to-day life of people with completely locked-in syndrome.\u201d Although at the moment, the device can only really help patients answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, the team said that many of the family members of those participating were elated at being able to communicate with family members after many years of silence. The details of the experiment were published PLOS Biology.\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

They discovered that decades of breeding tomatoes to make them grow larger and more resistant to disease has depleted many of the chemicals that gave tomatoes their distinctive taste and aroma, which combine to form their flavor.

Surveil Anyone Based On A Vague Tip", "body": "AT ITS LOWEST\u00a0level of investigative activity, on the basis of vague tips or broad intelligence interests, the FBI can follow people with airplanes, examine travel records, and analyze links between email, phone, and other records collected by intelligence agencies. Two large FBI manuals obtained by The Intercept, one of which is classified, offer previously unreleased information about just how powerful an intelligence apparatus the FBI draws on even for low-level checks, known as \u201cassessments.\u201d Assessments allow agents to look into tips or leads that don\u2019t meet the standard for opening an investigation, which requires specific information or allegations of wrongdoing \u2014 an \u201carticulable factual basis\u201d for suspicion, as FBI rules put it. In an assessment, by contrast, an agent just needs to give an \u201cauthorized purpose\u201d for their actions. Agents can open assessments \u201cproactively,\u201d in order to evaluate potential informants, collect intelligence about threats surrounding public events, study a field office\u2019s\u00a0geographical area, or gather information about a general phenomenon of interest to the bureau. When assessments were made an official\u00a0category in the last months of the George W. Bush administration,\u00a0civil liberties advocates\u00a0warned\u00a0that the change\u00a0eroded\u00a0limits imposed on the bureau after the abuses of J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI came to light in congressional investigations in the 1970s. Those limits set high standards for the FBI\u2019s investigations, requiring them to be tied to evidence of wrongdoing and adding layers of oversight. Advocates now say that the standard for opening an assessment is just too low, allowing for enormous amounts of information to be collected and retained even when nothing turns up. The FBI counters that assessments offer a\u00a0common-sense, expeditious means of\u00a0handling tips and doing due diligence\u00a0on potential threats. The bureau maintains that assessments are still subject to oversight and\u00a0are\u00a0usually quickly closed if they don\u2019t meet the threshold for a more intensive investigation.

Trials Fruit Picking Robot", "body": "Hiring people to pick out fruit in a warehouse may become a thing of the past, thanks to the British grocery company Ocado that is trialling a robot arm for the task. It may be a few years, however, until AI takes over the task, as the current technology, known as SoMa (Soft Manipulation) is an early prototype. This project, funded by the European Union and Disney, has been in trials for over 18 months. Ocado has just now allowed the public to view it in all of its glory. Thus far, Ocado has tested out two different hands to aid workers in warehouses. They have been RBO Hand 2 developed by the Technische Universit\u00e4t in Berlin; and the LBR iiwa14 by German robotics firm Kuk.\u00a0 Currently, they are also developing what is described as \u201chumanoid\u201d robot, known as SecondHands, which will assist human employees in the warehouse with related tasks.\u00a0 Although not ready to go on the market yet, the robotic arms demonstrated their ability to pick up and deposit fruit in a container without crushing it\u00a0or damaging it. The prototype only used fake fruit, but scientists say this is a huge leap forward in technology because fruit is amongst the most difficult to handle. Customers, they say, do not want their fruit dented or damaged, regardless of if a human or a robot\u00a0did the packaging. In the future, the robotic arms and SecondHands may be responsible for helping fulfil orders for customers and grocery stores alike. Instead of having a human being fulfil an order, the robot may be able to fetch the items, leaving the humans to check them over, load them\u00a0in trucks and take them off to their destination. Although the introduction of the technology has spurred some people to worry about the future of their jobs, Ocado has assured them that although some warehouses will be automated in the near future, they will still need many real live people for other jobs. They also purport that they are now creating jobs for engineers and scientists and helping create technology that may one day be used the world over.\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller", "links":

To Norman Yao, these inert crystals are the tip of the iceberg. If crystals have an atomic structure that repeats in space, like the carbon lattice of a diamond, why can\u2019t crystals also have a structure that repeats in time? That is, a time crystal? In a paper published online earlier this month in the journal Physical Review Letters, the UC Berkeley assistant professor of physics describes exactly how to make and measure the properties of such a crystal, and even predicts what the various phases surrounding the time crystal should be \u2014 akin to the liquid and gas phases of ice.

Known Human Ancestor", "body": "Scientists have recently discovered the world\u2019s oldest known human ancestor\u2013and it is 540 million years old.\u00a0 This microscopic, and rather unattractive, sea creature, is an ancient example of a \u201cdeuterostome,\u201d or a creature that eventually evolved into a wide array of species including vertebrates. The creature\u00a0that is described as \u201cbag-like\u201d due to the its wrinkled body, is known as a\u00a0Saccorhytus coronaries\u00a0and was discovered in central China, which during the period of this creature\u2019s existence would have been covered\u00a0by the ocean. Simon Conway Morris, a professor of evolutionary palaeobiology at the University of Cambridge, stated: \u201cWe think that as an early deuterostome, this may represent the primitive beginnings of a very diverse range of species, including ourselves.\u00a0To the naked eye, the fossils we studied look like tiny black grains, but under the microscope the level of detail is jaw-dropping.All deuterostomes had a common ancestor, and we think that is what we are looking at here.\u201d The previous earliest discover of deuterostomes were from 510 to 520 million years ago. Those, according to scientists, had already begun to diversify and turn into the earliest ancestors of different types of fish and other invertebrates. But this discovery takes us back even further in time. This microscopic animal had no arms or legs, and presumably made its way around by contracting its muscles. It also had a very large mouth in comparison to the rest of its body, meaning it likely ate food particles or even consumed other creatures. Notably, it also contained a conical structure on its body, which allowed it to release water and was possibly an early form of gills. Additionally, the creature does not appear to have an anus or any kind of other opening to release waste. Scientists speculate that it let go of unneeded material\u00a0by regurgitating it through the mouth.\u00a0 Scientists, however, are having a hard time finding any animals that now predate deuterosomes and the ancestors which birthed them. This is likely because these types of animals would be so small that it would be very difficult or almost impossible to find the fossils they have left behind. The findings and analysis of the new animal can be found in the journal Nature.\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller", "links": ["#content", "/",

Idea to Solve Highway Traffic Looks Like It Is Actually Happening", "body": "Forget flying cars. Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is going underground as soon as next month, the billionaire teased on Twitter this week. Inspired by Los Angeles\u2019 car congestion, his enthusiasm for tunnels has grown since meeting with President Donald Trump. \u201cExciting progress on the tunnel front,\u201d Musk tweeted Wednesday morning. \u201cPlan to start digging in a month or so.\u201d Known for chasing seemingly unattainable goals, the innovator who upturned the mobile finance industry by helping develop PayPal is now sounding quite serious about burrowing underneath L.A. and building new tunnels to alleviate the gridlock above. Musk may not have to dig too deep into his own pockets, however. Last November, Californians voted in favor of big infrastructure spending, while much of the rest of the country elected President Trump, who has vowed to approve some $1 trillion for shovel-ready jobs. In 2015, L.A. drivers spent an average of 81 hours idling on freeways, making the city the worst in the country for traffic jams, according to Inrix. \u201cTraffic is driving me nuts,\u201d Musk tweeted in December. \u201cAm going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.\u201d At the time, Musk declared his future tunneling business to be named The Boring Company. He didn\u2019t come up with the idea out of boredom, though. He just wanted to get to the airport sooner, and who doesn\u2019t? Responding to other tweets, he said his initial project would run from \u201cacross from my desk at SpaceX,\u201d to \u201cCrenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX.\u201d Musk met with Trump on Monday and praised the anticipated new secretary of state Rex Tillerson the following day on Twitter. Is Musk, a clean energy entrepreneur, making good with an old school oil tycoon? With Trump promising to allocate $1 trillion of taxpayer funds towards infrastructure programs, it\u2019s not a far cry to assume Musk is interested. Indeed, tunneling largely depends on government spending, which makes up 69.5 percent of the industry\u2019s revenue, USA Today reported. However, there are still issues of regulation, especially in California and particularly Los Angeles, where permits can be hard to come by. That may be the determining factor as to whether there will be any light at the end of Musk\u2019s tunnel vision.\n", "author_name": "Anti Media", "links": ["#content", "/",

Jupiter\u2019s Little Red Spot", "body": "The JunoCam imager on NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft snapped this shot of Jupiter\u2019s northern latitudes on Dec. 11, 2016 at 8:47 a.m. PST (11:47 a.m. EST), as the spacecraft performed a close flyby of the gas giant planet. The spacecraft was at an altitude of 10,300 miles (16,600 kilometers) above Jupiter\u2019s cloud tops.   This stunning view of the high north temperate latitudes fortuitously shows NN-LRS-1, a giant storm known as a Little Red Spot (lower left). This storm is the third largest anticyclonic reddish oval on the planet, which Earth-based observers have tracked for the last 23 years. An anticyclone is a weather phenomenon with large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure. They rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. This Little Red Spot shows very little color, just a pale brown smudge in the center. The color is very similar to the surroundings, making it difficult to see as it blends in with the clouds nearby. Citizen scientists Gerald Eichstaedt and John Rogers processed the image and drafted the caption. JunoCam\u2019s raw images are available at www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam for the public to peruse and process into image products. JPL manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott Bolton, of Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Juno is part of NASA\u2019s New Frontiers Program, which is managed at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate. Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, built the spacecraft.

Some researchers speculate that this was the seat of power for the Kingdom of\u00a0Rheged, which was previously thought to be in Carlisle or Cumbria. This small empire was governed by\u00a0King\u00a0Urien, who makes himself known in some of the legends featuring King Arthur. The Kingdom of Rheged has always been one of the most mysterious of the\u00a0period, reaching its heyday in the 6th century. It was also supposedly the site of the earliest Scottish Christian monument, the Latinus Stone, erected around 450 AD. The Galloway Picts Project, a\u00a0initiative that aims to study engravings from that period, accidentally stumbled on a few around the site in 2012. The engravings, however, may never be translated thoroughly as it may prove impossible to find the origins of Pictish words and symbols. After the discovery, the private firm private firm GUARD began digging around where the engravings were originally found. They unearthed a royal hall, a smith\u2019s workshop and a fort which was used to protect local royalty from neighboring kingdoms and the population at large. Christopher Bowles, an archaeologist with the Scottish Borders Council and co-author of the new book\u00a0The Lost Dark Age Kingdom of Rheged,\u00a0stated: \u201cThe people living at Trusty\u2019s Hill were not engaged in agriculture themselves.\u00a0Instead, this household\u2019s wealth relied on their control of farming, animal husbandry and the management of local natural resources \u2014 minerals and timber \u2014 from an estate probably spanning the wider landscape of the Fleet Valley and estuary. Control was maintained by bonding the people of this land and the districts beyond to the royal household, by gifts, promises of protection and the bounties of raiding and warfare.\u201d Archeologists also believe that those who lived in Trusty\u2019s Hill were at the top of the social hierarchy of the times, and that royal inauguration ceremonies took place there. It was confirmed that the royal hall was destroyed by a fire in the seventh century, as evidence by stone ramparts that had fused together from extreme heat.\n", "author_name": "Fiona Miller",

Google Removes 200 From Ad Network For Misleading Users", "body": "In an effort to rid the web of fake news, Google banned nearly 200 publishers from its advertising network in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the company\u2019s annual \u201cbad ads\u201d report released Wednesday. The crackdown came specifically in the months of November and December, following a change of policy for Google\u2019s ad network AdSense designed to punish sites that intentionally misrepresent who they are in order to deceive readers. The updated policy led to the review of 550 sites, including a considerable amount that were masquerading as legitimate news organizations. Google reported it took action against 340 of those sites and permanently banned about 200 of the violators from its advertising platform. The company also suspended more than 1,300 accounts for \u201ctabloid cloaking,\u201d a practice that became increasingly popular in 2016. The scam involves creating ads that purport to be news and information only to send users to a site trying to sell a questionable product when clicked. The ads are often targeted around current events.

Several dozen suspected terrorist bombmakers, including some believed to have targeted American troops, may have mistakenly been allowed to move to the United States as war refugees, according to FBI agents investigating the remnants of roadside bombs recovered from Iraq and Afghanistan.

suspected terrorists\u2019 fingerprints. \u201cWe are currently supporting dozens of current counter-terrorism investigations like that,\u201d FBI Agent Gregory Carl, director of the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), said in an ABC News interview to be broadcast tonight on ABC News\u2019 \u201cWorld News with Diane Sawyer\u201d and \u201cNightline\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were many more than that,\u201d said House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul. \u201cAnd these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking

activists say it will take to make Phoenix a sanctuary city. Stanton responded in a statement to a citizen petition presented to the City Council on Wednesday asking to change Phoenix Police Department policy and stop cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. While no exact definition exists of a sanctuary city, local activists have said it requires ending a department policy regarding immigration enforcement. Though community groups have for weeks escalated their calls for Stanton to change the policy, they aren\u2019t behind the petition the council expects to respond to on Feb. 15. It\u2019s unclear how the item will appear on the council agenda, or if council members will take a vote. Resident Rick Robinson filed the petition in response to President Trump\u2019s Jan. 25 executive order penalizing sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that \u201cwillfully violate\u201d federal immigration laws.

After US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning seven Muslim-majority countries last Friday, the Kuwaiti government has told would-be migrants from the five banned nations to not apply for visas, as it is worried about the possible migration of radical Islamic terrorists, Sputnik International reported. Under the executive order signed by Trump, refugees from all over the world will be denied US entry for 120 days while all immigration from so-called \u201ccountries with terrorism concerns\u201d will be suspended for 90 days. The countries included in the US ban are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Kuwait was the only nation to prohibit the entry of Syrian nationals prior to Trump\u2019s executive action. Kuwait City previously issued a suspension of visas for all Syrians in 2011.

immigrants to sue state and local politicians who defy federal immigration authorities seeking to enforce the law, multiple news outlets are reporting.

Dave Williams, who is Hispanic, said he wants to strip the \u201cimmunity\u201d from Democratic politicians who \u201cplace Coloradans in danger because of the sanctuary city policies that they created and continue to implement,\u201d the Denver Post reported. \u201cAs the first Latino elected to Colorado House District 15, I think it\u2019s important that we do all we can to uphold the rule of law and ensure all communities, regardless of race or ethnicity, are protected from dangerous policies that are forced on us by radical, out-of-touch politicians who continually sell out to an unlawful agenda that increases the number of criminals, and needless deaths among our fellow citizens,\u201d Williams said, according to The Colorado Statesman.

to Bring Down Hungarian Govt \u2013 Foreign Minister to RT", "body": "The activities of organizations funded by US billionaire investor George Soros in Hungary are \u201canti-democratic,\u201d as they want to undermine the government in Budapest, the foreign minister of Hungary told RT. Soros \u201cwould like this government to fail, he would like to kind of fire this government because he doesn\u2019t like our approach, doesn\u2019t like our policies,\u201d Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told RT\u2019s Sophie Shevardnadze. \u201cWe find it very anti-democratic if someone from abroad would like to influence Hungarian voters on whom to vote for,\u201d he asserted. Several days before the interview, the Hungarian parliament began to discuss a bill allowing authorities to audit NGO executives and request detailed reports on their foreign donations. Earlier in January, chairman of the ruling Fidesz party Szilard Nemeth said that \u201cthese organizations must be pushed back with all available tools, and I think they must be swept out, and now I believe the international conditions are right for this with the election of the new president [Donald Trump].\u201d Last September, Nemeth, who is also the deputy chairman of Hungary\u2019s National Security Committee, submitted a list of 22 NGOs \u201cconnected to the Soros network for the purpose of having these organizations screened.\u201d Foreign Minister Szijjarto said it is obviously the right of his country to be protected from foreign influence. \u201cThis is what we have heard a lot from the US for the last months \u2013 that external influence is so dangerous\u2026 So, it\u2019s a good reason \u2013 if this is the American position, it can be our position as well.\u201d Hungary, which lies at the very heart of Europe, last year became a main passageway for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees eager to reach northern European countries. The government, led by right-wing President Viktor Orban, responded by erecting fences along Hungary\u2019s borders and introducing strict border controls. Budapest has consistently refused EU-backed mandatory resettlement quotas, calling them a blow to member states\u2019 sovereignty. Szijjarto cited intelligence reports alleging that \u201cthere were organizations which helped illegal migrants find ways to Hungary, to find where they could violate our border, to find out how to apply for asylum status, and these reports have said that George Soros was in the background of these organizations.\u201d Countries to Hungary\u2019s east and south are concerned about Soros\u2019 operations, too. In Macedonia, an organization called Stop Operation Soros (SOS) has been launched. Its founder, Nikola Srbov, accused Soros of hijacking civil society, calling upon followers to \u201cfight against one-mindedness in the civil sector, which is devised and led by Soros,\u201d according to Vecer\u00a0newspaper. Russian prosecutors branded the Open Society Foundation (OSF), a major Soros asset, and Open Society Institute\u2019s Assistance Foundation threats to the country\u2019s constitutional order and national security in 2015, and banned them from providing grants to Russian partners. Groups run by Soros have also been accused of meddling in Ukrainian affairs and supporting the 2013 Euromaidan protests that led to the ouster of democratically-elected President Viktor Yanukovich.\n", "author_name": "Breitbart", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/", "http://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerickJones",

Surveillance Towers Along Mexican Border", "body": "On January 18, a week before Donald Trump issued Wednesday\u2019s executive order\u00a0decreeing the immediate construction of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency posted a \u201cRequest for Information\u201d to a federal database of government contract opportunities for private businesses. Although released without fanfare, the solicitation appears to be one of the earliest operational glimpses into the federal government\u2019s plans for heightened security along U.S. land borders under the Trump administration. The request makes clear that in the days preceding Trump\u2019s swearing in, CBP was already taking steps to dramatically scale up its surveillance capabilities along the U.S.-Mexico border. Because of the often treacherous and desolate terrain along the country\u2019s 1,954-mile southern land border, many have speculated that in such areas Trump\u2019s wall could be more of a digital surveillance shield composed of video camera towers\u00a0and drones that scan for border crossing activity. Now, according to the documents, the CBP is \u201ccontemplating an expansion\u201d of Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS)\u00a0that would deploy the program\u2019s digital watchtowers to some of the border\u2019s most isolated regions.

Reveals US Urged Saddam Hussein to Attack Syria", "body": "Despite what even some alternative media commentators might argue, the Syrian war is about oil, gas, and money. A\u00a0secret 1983 intelligence report has confirmed that America\u2019s distaste for the Assad family in Syria has always revolved around pipeline disputes \u2014 and this alone has given the U.S. cause to go to war with Syria. Most disturbingly, the report revealed that the United States urged Saddam Hussein to attack Hafez al-Assad in Syria because of the closure of Iraq\u2019s oil pipeline. The report by former senior CIA official Graham Fuller urged the U.S. to consider \u201curging Iraq to take the war to Syria,\u201d noting Saddam was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d in the Iran-Iraq campaign. The closure of the Iraq pipeline was seen to have a \u201chammerlock\u201d on U.S. interests in the region. Fuller said the U.S. should consider \u201csharply escalating the pressures against Assad\u201d from three border states hostile to Syria \u2013 Iraq, Israel, and Turkey. The report claimed that faced with these \u201cthree belligerent fronts,\u201d Assad would probably be forced to abandon his closure of the pipeline. Sound familiar? It is\u00a0alleged that in 2009, Qatar put forward a pipeline proposal that would run through Syria and Turkey and be used to export Saudi and Qatari gas. The Syrian regime turned down this proposal, and instead, forged an agreement with Iran and Iraq to run a pipeline into Europe, cutting out the Gulf States completely. Since then, these regional players have been the\u00a0most vehement opponents of the Assad regime because they view the expansion of the Shia-led bloc of Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria as a major economic threat. Anyone who claims the Obama administration and its allies, including\u00a0Saudi Arabia, were motivated by human rights concerns in Syria is either misinformed or lying.\u00a0It has been speculated that Israel has been looking to exploit the Syrian war by tapping into sources of oil in the Golan Heights area, which the oil company Afek claims is part of the \u201cState of Israel\u201d. At the time U.S. intelligence produced the secret report on Hafez al-Assad, the U.S. was not only arming and supporting Saddam Hussein\u2019s war of aggression on neighboring Iran (rife with the use of chemical weapons), they were also\u00a0caught red-handed arming the Iranians in order to maximize the death toll. According to the secret report, the U.S. was looking to expand the death toll in Iraq and Syria as well, all because of a pipeline closure. It seems as though the same economic interests remain at the heart of America\u2019s relationships with other nations. Perhaps U.S. allies in the Middle East should take note of this bipolar foreign policy and take heed of what happened to Saddam Hussein, who went from receiving unfaltering support from the U.S. to being public enemy number one. This is especially true with President Trump, who appears to have\u00a0undone Obama\u2019s cold war approach to Russia and thus far attempted to create a productive dialogue with Vladimir Putin. Trump also\u00a0appears to differ with the Gulf States regarding the correct approach to the Syrian war. It will be an unpredictable next few years. That being said, Trump\u00a0already looks set to continue Obama\u2019s most dangerous policies.\n", "author_name": "Anti Media", "links": ["#content", "/",

Ruling Elite", "body": "Two extreme, very polarized paradigms have emerged as President Donald Trump takes command of the White House. After the shattered hopes and fraud perpetrated by America\u2019s first black hope-exploiting president, Trump supporters naively believe they\u2019ve elected their \u201cgreat white hope\u201d of a president who will \u201cmake America great again,\u201d taking at face value his \u201cAmerica comes first\u201d rhetoric. Many see Trump as a modern day George Washington figure, leading Americans in their second revolution, fighting to take back their country from the globalists. But Trump\u2019s legions of supporters fail to realize that the entrenched power machine that appears to reluctantly and covertly be behind Trump\u2019s ascendance at the same time opposing him at every turn is in fact the very same power elite that\u2019s been backing his opponent all along \u2013 the Hillary-Obama-Bush DC establishment cabal. Indeed the trumped up \u201cestablishment outsider\u201d image that\u2019s won Trump the presidency belies the fact that in actuality he is an establishment insider who until now just hasn\u2019t held political office. In stark contrast to the new president\u2019s loyal constituency, the anti-Trump, \u201cliberal-minded,\u201d pro-Clinton-Soros-CIA minions\u2019 world-view steadfastly insist that Donald Trump along with \u201cpartner-in-crime\u201c Vladimir Putin are the devil incarnate themselves. To do an actual reset with Russia (unlike Obama\u2019s fake one 8 years ago) and cease the neocons\u2019 insane push for WWIII, within weeks President Trump will be meeting with Putin in Iceland\u2019s capital. Of course Trump haters will see this as \u201cproof\u201d the two were in cahoots all along to \u201csteal\u201d the election. Blindfolded morons will stay morons, always seeing what they want to see. Meanwhile, America has never been this divided a nation since the War Between the States more than a century and a half ago. With present battle lines so bitterly and fiercely drawn, the planetary rulers are once again laughing in their mansions over having so effectively divided and conquered Americans as their reliable go-to formula for strengthening their power and control over the masses, regardless of who occupies the White House, setting the stage for America\u2019s second civil war and Europe\u2019s counterpart. Speculation amongst those following the money behind these two polarized political camps posit a Hatfield versus McCoy inner power struggle within the global elite currently taking place between the Clinton-Bush-Obama-Soros crowd backed by the Rothschild cartel and a Trump-Netanyahu/Sheldon Adelson-Kissinger-soft countercoup merger supported by the Rockefeller cabal, and that the real powerline story here might be the Rothschild versus the Rockefeller feud competing and vying for increased power and control at the expense of the other. Yet this too is far more apt to just be more sleight of hand chicanery to project an illusion of difference between the Trump and Clinton camps. Bottom line \u2013 deep pocket money from both the Rothschild and Rockefeller dynasties have been funding both Hillary and Trump. Even the West versus East showdown leading humanity towards World War III could secretly be the pre-plotted machinations between the Western oligarchs and the Eastern oligarchs. How much of this economic and geopolitical division is real or unreal is extremely difficult to determine and prove or disprove. With elitist shills controlling both the mainstream media as well as much of the alternative media, deciphering actual truth becomes nearly impossible. Perhaps one helpful method of seeking the truth can be conveniently found on the mainstream media\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d list that blacklists 200 actual alt news sites that ironically most closely approximate and consistently deliver the truth. That said, the truth that we can sure of is that for well over a century the ruling elite has backed and promoted both sides to every major war it manufactures, just as it has selected, backed and promoted every two-party candidate who ends up its president, keyword being \u201cits\u201d president as no president over the last half century has clearly acted in the best interests of American citizens. We\u2019ve been living in an oligarchy where a handful of power brokers control the masses because they own and control virtually all the elected representatives who function on their explicit behalf rather than their constituent voters\u2019 behalf. And sadly, it\u2019s been operating this way in America for a very long time. On January 20th Donald Trump opened his presidency with a fiery 16-minute inaugural address that in a nutshell encapsulated his 18-month campaign, spouting his populist rabble-rousing message. Having said that he himself would be writing his inauguration speech, in his first presidential oratorical display, in essence the brand new Commander-in-Chief just declared war against the ruling elite: For too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have bore the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Donald Trump goes on to describe \u201cmothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories\u201d across our nation, an education system depriving students \u201cof all knowledge,\u201d and \u201cthe crime and gangs and drugs\u201d robbing \u201cour country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\u201d Trump follows with: We are one nation, and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. Unlike his critics claiming that Trump failed to offer words that unify the divided nation, the president\u2019s accurate observations of a nation in decline were followed immediately by statements reaching out to and inclusive of the millions of forgotten and downtrodden Americans who\u2019ve been left behind by an ever-widening inequality gap that only benefits the wealthy class. Yet the consensus review by mainstream media that vehemently opposes Trump responded predictably, calling it \u201ccombative,\u201d \u201cdivisive,\u201d \u201cpolarizing\u201d and \u201cgloomy.\u201d Answering millions of his liberal haters insisting from day one of his candidacy that Trump is nothing but a racist wannabe dictator who\u2019ll rival Hitler\u2019s coldblooded tyranny, the newly sworn-in president predicts: A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It\u2019s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget \u2013 that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. Rather than echoing the usual sentiments that past inaugural addresses customarily deliver, espousing the Politically Correct clich\u00e9d pretenses calling for mending the differences while repeatedly resorting to flowery references to America\u2019s glorious past, Trump once again defied tradition, angrily fighting against status quo elitism. But his contentious tone was clearly not directed at the American people, but limited to the Washington insiders, many of whom sat in the audience appearing uncomfortable hearing Trump directly attack them for nearly destroying America to make themselves and the rich richer and the rest of us poorer. In contrast, Trump stated: That a nation exists to serve its citizens\u2026 We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. True to their heavily biased repulsion towards Trump, the mainstream presstitutes didn\u2019t hesitate to trash Trump\u2019s first presidential speech. A day later on Saturday the new White House press secretary Sean Spicer held an impromptu first press conference to push back against the faulty inauguration day coverage, citing a false tweet claiming Trump removed a Martin Luther King bust from the Oval Office and the New York Times disputing the inauguration crowd size based on a White House tweeted photo. Spicer said Trump is trying to unify the country but it requires fair reporting by the press that on his very first day was grossly lacking. With the press and Trump sworn enemies prior to inauguration, the war will only become more volatile. And with Trump haters the dominant majority in the media and a thin-skinned reactionary for president, the fireworks have only just begun. The mega media outlets all made certain to repeatedly emphasize that Trump suffers the lowest approval rating at 40% for any incoming president in history. Ironically the three previous presidents who will go down in that same US history for nearly destroying America \u2013 Bill Clinton, Bush junior and Obama \u2013 all had approval ratings at their outset 20% or higher than Trump. Obama, perhaps the worst president in history, entered the White House with a 79% approval. And if this survey is anything like all those pre-election polls, it too is rigged as Trump is quick to point out. MSM also focused on how near 70 Democratic Party politicians in symbolic protest refused to even attend the inaugural ceremony and how the attendance was roughly half of Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration. The fake-stream press of course works in tandem with the fake Hollywood entertainment industry. So the media went out of its way to feature each and every celebrity who publicly refused to perform at Trump\u2019s big day commencement events. On inauguration eve all the A-list celebs joined thousands of New Yorkers, Michael Moore and their mayor protesting outside Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower. Receiving the most airtime were Trump\u2019s opposition forces gathering in the Big Apple and the Washington Mall. The star-studded kickoff on Thursday night in New York had the likes of Madonna, Cher, Robert Deniro and their ringleader Michael Moore leading the counteroffensive charge with his \u201cfirst 100 days of resistance,\u201d designed to rain their propaganda woes on Trump\u2019s parade. Moore lathered up the crowd warning that America has entered \u201ca very dangerous\u201d time after electing a \u201csociopath.\u201d Interesting to note that it\u2019s the certifiable sociopath Obama whose agenda has been to plunge America into WWIII with Russia that all these anti-Trumpsters worship while the new president\u2019s aim is to avert war against Putin as a potential life extinction event. But then these people conveniently overlook those small details. Rather than ponder that reality, MSM \u201cfake news\u201d prefers to concentrate all eyes on the so-called resistance movement, endowed with $10 million of globalist regime changer George Soros money. Never mind that the Soros hired anti-Trump leftist brigade turns violent, that\u2019s what they\u2019re paid to do. In Washington they again clashed and injured half-dozen police officers in riot gear that countered with pepper spray and concussion grenades. When the Soros mercenaries weren\u2019t blocking Air Force veterans from the inaugural ceremony, they were busy rioting as brick-throwing vandals shattering a number of storefront windows, setting fire to a limousine and causing extensive property damage that resulted in 217 arrests. Those swept up in the turmoil and detained in Washington are apparently being held on felony riot charges punishable up to ten years in prison. Local police were joined by a deployment of National Guard units and Homeland Security. It appears that police state under Obama remains police state under Trump. Additionally, 15 arrests were made in New Orleans after a couple of patrol car windows were smashed and two police officers were injured. Armed with bottles, rocks and bats the anti-Trump protesters showed their real colors. This same violence was observed elsewhere, resulting in five arrests in Portland, Oregon and three in Oakland in addition to a man shot at a Seattle demonstration. And while on Saturday the women\u2019s multiple-city marches were being hyped up in the national press, Madonna was at it again, firing up the DC crowd with little Molotov cocktail gems like \u201cI thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House\u201d but luckily for the Donald she knows that \u201cthis won\u2019t change anything.\u201d Being a celebrity, she must have figured she could get away with threatening to kill the president of the United States. The Secret Service has taken her violent threat seriously and Madonna now finds herself under investigation. Officials claim a half million strong marched where Trump was sworn into office the day before. The so-called anti-Trump movement was touted as a worldwide event with \u201csister marches\u201d taking place in 600 locations across America as well as in Myanmar, Sydney, Copenhagen, Berlin and Prague. Meanwhile, receiving little MSM attention was the fact that women from a pro-life group that were originally a co-sponsor of Saturday\u2019s \u201cunity\u201d march were banned from participation. Thus, those not sharing the same political dogma as the march organizers were expressly forbidden, leaving on full display the hypocritical inconsistency of practicing the very same exclusionary behavior attributed to Trump that supposedly was the very purpose of conducting the protest. Obviously the inclusionary message within Trump\u2019s speech was totally ignored by these same anti-Trump protesters and the mass media. It\u2019s stunningly amazing how the \u201cprogressive-minded, so inclusive\u201d left, always preaching unity while professing to be such staunch anti-globalists, anti-TPP, peace-loving anti-interventionists, yet on Soros cue they can turn dangerously violent, starting riots, and making threats to blow up the White House. Then they worship politicians like Obama and the Clintons who have pushed the globalist agenda more than any other American leaders in history. And now that we finally have a president committed to anti-globalism and non-interventionism, other than eliminating the terrorists that Obama and Hillary created, the progressive left is determined to take him down. The last US president who exercised any real conscience and resolve to shake up the power establishment by acting in the best interests of the American people never made it past his first term in office. And the same criminal operation that took down JFK \u2013 key players within the CIA, the CFR and Kennedy administration including his own VP LBJ, those same shadow government rogue elements still remain alive and fully in power today. Case in point, that same CIA has bogusly charged Trump with colluding with Putin to overturn the election outcome, which has proven to be false. Yet sore-losing Democrats are still falsely claiming the lie in desperation to delegitimize and undermine the Trump presidency. And finally, the same CIA guilty of plotting and murdering JFK is still scheming and plotting the demise of President Donald J. Trump. The very real prospect of Trump getting assassinated during his presidency has been repeatedly kept on the table, mostly couched in hypothetical terms behind barely contained wishful thinking by hordes of fake stream pundits and commentators representing the same crime cabal still in power. Not so veiled threats to Trump\u2019s life have been brashly hyped repeatedly by all six oligarch owned and controlled mega media giants as well as Washington\u2019s elite. Clearly many both in and out of the seats of power do want Trump dead. Last February a New York Times columnist \u201cjoked\u201d about ultimately halting Trump\u2019s presidential campaign by assassination. Several weeks later conservative talk show host Glenn Beck threatened on the air to repeatedly \u201cstab Trump.\u201d Then in June just three months later a 20-year old British citizen actually did attempt to assassinate Trump, trying to pull a gun out a police officer\u2019s holster at a Las Vegas rally. Ever since late 2015 when the inflammatory Trump emerged as the Republican frontrunner for good, aside from ongoing death threats from the left on social media, a rapper and a couple of GOP establishment strategists also joined the fray openly calling for Trump\u2019s assassination apparently with complete impunity. But now that Trump\u2019s president, all that has changed. Ask Madonna. Recently more assassination concerns have been voiced by conspiracy theorists surrounding Trump\u2019s upcoming inauguration. As perhaps the most blatant anti-Trump mainstream fake news network, CNN has notoriously carried the assassination torch right up to inauguration day. It\u2019s as if CNN and others like Madonna are subliminally planting the seed to incite other lame brains into MK Ultraviolent reaction to take down the 45th US president. And with so many mentally unstable individuals out there, and mind control techniques utilizing black ops electromagnetic weaponry, undoubtedly more attempts on Trump\u2019s life are bound to be in store. Another aging remnant linked to the Kennedy assassination is the still alive George H.W. Bush who, as a young Skull & Bones CIA operative, was photographed in front of the book depository building in Dallas the same day Kennedy was assassinated. And H.W.\u2019s still alive war criminal son was observed still smirking, laughing and joking with his fellow cabalist war criminal cronies the Clintons and Obama at the inauguration, just prior to the one man who successfully thwarted the Bush-Clinton-Obama dynasty after near four decades, began outing them as traitors. Suddenly the smirk disappeared. After opening his inaugural address lavishing compliments on Barack Obama for being so graciously helpful during the presidential transition, the just sworn in President Trump then proceeded to expose both Congress and all the attending former presidents for turning their backs on the American people, stopping just short of calling them America\u2019s traitors from within, which of course they clearly are. Trump\u2019s speech was his first shot across the bow as the brand new sheriff in town, directly blaming those in Washington for selling America out to foreign interests, selling off American workers to offshore foreign factories and globalist \u201cfree\u201d trade deals, selling off America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure to costly hegemonic wars overseas, selling off America\u2019s national security AND citizens\u2019 legal rights for Obama\u2019s illegal permanent war that\u2019s made us far less safe with an open border policy inviting terrorist cells to flourish on US soil, selling off and abandoning America\u2019s poor and middle classes for military industrial security complex profit and greed, and selling America out to a globalized fake mass media. In his inauguration speech Trump laid out a plan to stop the bleeding and reverse the damage, reiterating all his campaign priorities as a nationalist, clearly opposing globalism as his enemy. To millions of long forgotten Americans viciously victimized by elitist rulers, his words came as music to their ears, reinforcing their belief that finally a president has arrived who\u2019s once again looking out for them. Caution bears not getting your hopes up too high but simply holding Trump to his word. Of course eight years ago after surviving eight painful years under Bush and Cheney\u2019s reign of terror, Obama promised to end unwinnable foreign wars and deliver the most open and transparent presidency in US history that so captured and resonated with America\u2019s hopes, was also welcomed as music to our ears. Soon enough though, we learned Obama\u2019s domestic and foreign policies were pretty much the same as his predecessors and that voting a Democrat or a Republican into the White House really didn\u2019t matter at all when the puppet in charge is never actually in charge. Like clockwork every eight years, America\u2019s short-term memory forces us to relive the disillusioning nightmare of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again\u2026 that the new boss turns out to be same as the old boss simply because he\u2019s never been the boss to begin with. The figurehead occupying the White House has always taken his marching orders directly from the ruling elite. Perhaps the globalist design to dumb down Americans has been so successful that we may never learn this critical history lesson, however harsh the consequences. If Trump really does mean business and attempts to make good on his campaign promise to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d finishing the job that JFK started by abolishing the CIA, Trump most definitely has his work cut out for him. Once he completes that task, he must move on to destroying destructive, enslaving monsters like the Federal Reserve, Homeland Security and the DEA, drastically reducing the self-serving cancerous bureaucracy and cronyism of ever-sprawling big government. In addition to gutting the feds\u2019 fat, President Trump\u2019s priorities must also include eliminating the parasitic glut of thousands of private contractors, bilking billions more from taxpayers. Trump must also normalize relations with Russia (as well with China and Iran), and in partnership as mentioned in his inaugural, eradicate the cabal\u2019s proxy ally the terrorists \u201coff the face of the earth.\u201d Trump needs to revoke all the unconstitutionalObama executive orders as well as dismantle and repeal a number of Obama passed laws, including reinstating the Smith-Mundt Act to once again hold all the fake MSM accountable for propagating unlawful lies and false propaganda. Perhaps more important than anything else, President Trump needs to restore the US Constitution as America\u2019s rule of law and our government back to a democratic republic. Trump\u2019s website promises he will honor and uphold our Constitution as taking his oath of office demands. That means he needs to immediately begin rolling back the totalitarian police state tyranny and invasive violation of our constitutional freedoms already demolished under the Bush-Obama regime. Finally, Trump built his entire campaign on the promise to jump start the lifeless national economy by creating massive employment opportunity for millions of under- and unemployed Americans, vowing to create 25 million jobs within the decade. He also says that he\u2019ll entice many companies back to the US as well as resurrect our lost manufacturing base and shrinking middle class. A tall if not impossible order that again we need to hold him to the task. Shortly after President Kennedy warned of the shadow government and made it known he was committed to a course of peace instead of war (calling for withdrawal of all US military advisors from Vietnam), eliminating the CIA (prior to it eliminating him) and signing Executive Order 11110 that threatened to cut the authority of the Federal Reserve banksters by returning responsibility of America\u2019s money supply over to the US Treasury, President Kennedy was suddenly shot dead. On a parallel course, Trump insists that he will not go to war with Russia or interfere in other nations\u2019 internal affairs, and last week he called NATO \u201cobsolete,\u201d a radical departure from the hyper-aggressive unipolar US foreign policy. He\u2019s also made overtures to end the Federal Reserve and the CIA, all reminiscent of our last assassinated president. For Trump to avoid this same tragic fate and be victorious in thoroughly \u201cdraining the swamp,\u201d he will need to move gradually, steadily and stealthily, exercising extreme prudence and caution while navigating the formidable economic and geopolitical minefield that his powerful enemies have laid before him. The Federal Reserve will soon be raising interest rates that will tighten the wallets of already strapped Americans, 76% of whom are living one paycheck away from homelessness. Interest rates across the boards on housing mortgages as well as credit cards and bank loans will be going up significantly in 2017. The elite\u2019s policy in recent years has been to kick the can down the road temporarily averting the impending financial crash, that is until after Trump becomes president. Last week\u2019s Davos meeting agenda no doubt placed the final touches on the globalist timetable to implode the house of cards economy this year. Be prepared for the 3 plus cents worth on our dollar since the Federal Reserve took over in 1913 to shrink even further into oblivion as the financial crisis deepens, and the US dollar/petrodollar as international reserve currency slips into its death throes. Hyperinflation will kick in and soon enough the United States will likely be following the same gloomy path as countries like current Venezuela and Zimbabwe 15 years ago. By globalist design the currency demonetization occurring in Venezuela and India will be arriving soon in the US. After all, absolute NWO surveillance and control can best be attained only when living in a cashless society. With the national debt soaring to near $20 trillion, when the SHTF, like in Cyprus and Austria, expect the likelihood of bail-ins where you wake up one day to find your personal life savings stolen out of your private bank account. Gas, energy and food prices will be rising and in a crisis, grocery shelves will quickly empty. Americans are pretty jumpy and jittery these days. When earlier this month a minor winter storm moved across the south and southeastern US, it caused public panic. If an actual major crisis suddenly hits, you can imagine the outcome. On hungry stomachs, civil unrest quickly turns to uncivilized violence that could sweep across the nation, especially in large urban areas. And of course now that we have a brand new president already on tenuous ground as the elite\u2019s designated fall guy, President Trump will be blamed. Buckle up folks, 2017\u2019s shaping up to be one hell of a bumpy ride. Stay alert and informed, be prepared for the worst, and hope for the best.\n", "author_name": "LewRockwell.com", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

Change 2016 Election Outcome", "body": "Believe it or not, while fake news was more prevalent than ever during the 2016 election, it did not change the outcome, according to a new study. In a study\u00a0released on January 18, titled \u201cSocial Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,\u201d NYU economics professor Hunt Allcott and Stanford economics professor Matthew Gentzkow conducted a series of tests to determine which fake news articles were being circulated, how much they were shared and viewed, and what impact they had on voters. Allcott and Gentzkow conducted a 1,200-person post-election online survey and used previous studies and web browser data to conclude that social media was an important source of information, but it was not a dominant source of information. Their survey found only 14 percent of Americans viewed social media as their \u201cmost important\u201d source of election news Allcott and Gentzkow tracked stories that were categorized as fake news by fact-checkers, and found that pro-Trump stories were shared over three times more than pro-Clinton articles. Pro-Trump stories were shared a total of 30 million times, compared to pro-Clinton articles, which were only shared a total of 7.6 million times. Researchers also polled the number of Americans who believed fake news articles by asking if they recalled fake news headlines, and if they thought they were true. In their\u00a0survey, researchers found that 15 percent of Americans could recall seeing a fake news headlines, and 8 percent said they believed them. At the same time, a separate survey,\u00a0conducted by Craig Silverman and Jeremy Singer-Vine, found that 10-22 percent of respondents said they recalled fake news stories. However, for their study, Allcott and Gentzkow also added their own fake news headlines as a placebo, and found that the number of people who remembered the placebo headlines were almost identical to the number of people who recalled the fake news headlines that were in circulation. Subtracting the placebo recalls from the fake recalls, Allcott and Gentzkow suggest that the true recall and belief of fake news articles was quite low. A recent survey from Pew Research Center showed that 62 percent of voters get their news from social media sites, however, of these, only 18 percent said they often do so. Another 18 percent said they never get their news from social media. By comparison, the survey showed that 46 percent of voters say they primarily get news from local television, and 31 percent from cable television. Only 34 percent of voters say they trust information they get from social media, while 76 percent have faith in national news organizations and 82 percent believe local news organizations to be credible. When Allcott and Gentzkow asked which news source was the most important for voters during the election, the four most common responses were cable TV, network TV, websites, and local TV, with social media coming in as the fifth most common response. Allcott and Gentzkow suggest that television still remains more important \u201cby a large margin.\u201d The study concluded by stating \u201cfor fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads.\u201d\n", "author_name": "RT", "links": ["#content", "/",

record in \u2018world\u2019s toughest\u2019 5,000km row across Atlantic", "body": "Hennigan\u00a0was taking part in the\u00a0Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge, which claims on its official website to be the\u00a0\u201cworld\u2019s toughest row\u201d\u00a0and proudly boasts that\u00a0\u201cmore people have been into space or climbed Everest than have rowed the Atlantic.\u201d  Update from the Mid Atlantic\u2026 Folk may wonder when they see the Zig Zag on the tracker this morning. #rowgavrow Gavan was hit by some very heavy weather last night. It started to knock him backwards so he deployed the sea anchor. It was on a short rope initially but he was still drifting at over half a knot so he put it out on a longer line and that held him steady. He has had very little sleep over the past few days and was exhausted by the time the squalls past and he hauled the sea anchor back on board he was unable to row. So he hit the bunk and caught up on some badly needed recovery sleep. He is relieved to hear the crewed competition didn\u2019t gain during this period and most seem to have been hit by the same weather. Marvel comics will be investigating his abilities after this! Detailed weather forecasting is very difficult in mid ocean because there are few data points available. It looks like he will have another 36 hours or so of mixed light weather and then it looks like the badly needed trade winds get re-established. A photo posted by Gavan Hennigan (@soulogav) on Jan 15, 2017 at 4:11am PST    The bearded Hennigan made the grueling 3,000 nautical mile (5,000km) journey in a specialized ocean rowing boat across the world\u2019s second largest ocean from San Sebastian in La Gomera, Canary Islands, to Nelson\u2019s Dockyard English Harbour, Antigua in the Caribbean. Upon finishing the mammoth journey, the tattoo-sporting adventurer from Galway celebrated the achievement on his boat, brandishing an Irish tricolor and clad in green, white and orange shorts with\u00a0\u201cIreland\u201d\u00a0emblazoned on the rear. \u201cI just got sent through some of the stuff and I\u2019m just absolutely blown away by the amount of people following me, people following the tracker sending messages of support,\u201d\u00a0said Gavan in his first interview after finishing the race, given portside while still standing on his boat. \u201cI had so many messages of well wishes and people just telling me to keep going. I\u2019d get up a few days and I\u2019d really be struggling and I\u2019d just read a few of those just to help me keep going.  After 49 days and 5000km\u2026 #twac2016 #rowgavrow A photo posted by Gavan Hennigan (@soulogav) on Feb 1, 2017 at 6:17pm PST    \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it without everyone\u2019s help. Seriously, it\u2019s amazing. Thanks to everyone back home in Ireland. I\u2019m so proud as an Irish person to come in and do this race. Not many Irish people have done it. \u201cJust to represent the country, just to fly the flag, it\u2019s been amazing,\u201d\u00a0he added. Hennigan, who bore a resemblance to MMA superstar and fellow countryman\u00a0Conor McGregor\u00a0in his celebratory outfit, became only the second Irish person to complete the challenge after Shane McGowan \u2013 whose record Hennigan beat by 69 days, therefore also setting a national record. The feat is all the more impressive given that Hennigan battled drug and drink addiction for most of his youth as he struggled to admit his homosexuality. It eventually landed him in rehab at the age of 21. Following his recovery, Hennigan worked as an oil rig worker before becoming an\u00a0\u201cextreme environment athlete,\u201dcompleting challenges such as travelling 700km north to south across Lake Baikal in Russia with a 60kg sled in 17 days. Hennigan, who goes by the name \u2018Soulo Gav\u2019 when competing, completed the challenge while\u00a0raising money\u00a0for youth mental health charity\u00a0Jigsaw Galway\u00a0and\u00a0Cancer Care West. He raised\u00a0over \u20ac12,000 ($13,000) for local Galway charities by taking on two Arctic races.  Made it!!!

Blamed Trump For Iraqi Mother\u2019s Death", "body": "Imam Husham Al-Hussainy says that a woman, whose son Mike Hager told US broadcasters that President Trump\u2019s \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 resulted in his mother\u2019s death, actually died a few days before the order was signed. According to the imam, the woman died on January 21 or 22 \u2013 before Trump signed the divisive travel ban. Before that, Mike Hager spoke to the imam and told him he was going to Iraq to be with the woman, who suffered from kidney disease. Al-Hussainy added that he had learnt about the woman\u2019s death through Facebook posts and worshippers at his mosque. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he lied. I don\u2019t know what Mike said. But Muslims have to tell the truth,\u201d Al-Hussainy said, as cited by AP. On January 31, Mike Hager commented to TV stations in Boston and Detroit that his mother had to stay in Iraq, despite his attempts to bring her to the US, and died there. Hager said he was visiting Iraq along with his family, when his mother\u2019s condition deteriorated. Hager is a US citizen, but other family members are not, and they had to remain in Iraq. Last week, an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump imposed a blanket ban on all Syrian asylum-seekers until \u201csufficient changes\u201d are made to the refugee program, and barred entry for the citizens of six other Arab countries. The order also halted all refugee admissions for at least 120 days, or four months. The measure has caused immense uproar, with thousands protesting in US airports and all over the country for days. However, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that more Americans (49 percent) support the ban than disapprove (41 percent). At the same time, 31 percent of the respondents said the ban made them feel safer, while 26 percent said it made them feel less safe, and 43 percent said they \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d \n",

Protect America From ISIS", "body": "In an interview on BBC, Nigel Farage praised President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to temporarily halt the flow of incomers from nations known to be hotbeds of jihad and terrorism. \u201cTrump was elected to protect America from ISIS terrorists. He is doing exactly that,\u201d wrote Farage in his commentary on the video. When asked if Farage agreed with the executive action, he replied, \u201cI do, because I think that if you just look at what is happening in France and Germany \u2013 if you just look at Mrs. Merkel\u2019s policy on this, which was to allow anybody in, virtually from anywhere, look what it has led to.\u201d Farage also assessed that Trump is simply carrying out the expressed will of the American people. \u201cI believe in the concept called \u2018democracy\u2019 \u2013 a point that has been missed by almost all commentators, especially with the BBC,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was elected to get tough. He was elected to say he would do everything in his power to protect America from infiltration by ISIS terrorists.\u201d \u201cThere are seven countries on that list. He is entitled to do this.\u201d A January poll conducted by Quinnipiac University revealed that 48% percent of voters support \u201csuspending immigration from \u2018terror prone\u2019 regions, even if it means turning away refugees from those regions.\u201d Only 42% opposed the suspension.  Brigitte Gabriel, survivor of the Lebanese Civil War and leading anti-Sharia activist, notes that the mainstream media is pushing the falsehood of a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d when it is actually a ban on immigrants and visitors from dangerous countries that happen to be predominantly Islamic \u2013 whether coincidence, or not.  \u201cThere is no \u2018Muslim ban.\u2019 There is a ban from countries with high levels of terrorist activity. It\u2019s not our fault those just happen to be almost entirely Islamic\u2026\u201d she wrote. Dan Bongino, former Secret Service agent and political commentator, has also come forward to debunk the myth of a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d in a video directed at the \u201cmanipulative, biased, lying mainstream media.\u201d  \u201cIf there was a \u2018Muslim ban,\u2019 then why doesn\u2019t the language in the executive order say anything about an actual ban on Muslims?\u201d asked Bongino. \u201cHere\u2019s what the executive order said: It put a temporary restriction on immigration from seven war-torn countries that have a history of a terrorism, where we may have a vetting problem.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re manipulating the American people because you\u2019re a bunch of BSers. You want them to believe something happened that didn\u2019t happen\u2026 This fake outrage campaign is another AstroTurf, far left campaign to make you believe something that is absolutely not true.\u201d Dan Lyman: Facebook | Twitter  \u00a0\n", "author_name": "Dan Lyman", "links": ["#content", "/", "https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/",

order on refugees. When being interviewed by the media, Darweesh said, \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation. The greatest people in the world.\u201d Asked his opinion of President Trump, he said: \u201cI like him, but I don\u2019t know. This is a policy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Leftist agitator Rep.

\u2018The Making of the President 2016\u2019: How Donald Trump Rode the Wave of Alternate Media to Become President", "body": "On November 8th, 2016, Donald John Trump was elected the forty-fifth President of the United States. This is a singular accomplishment that can only be attributed to the talent, energy, and foresight of Donald Trump himself. Trump\u2019s sprint across eight states in the closing days led to the greatest upset since 1948, when President Harry S Truman barnstormed across the country by train, breaking all railroad speed regulations, making six or seven stops per day, and ensuring his victory over New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey. The physical energy that Trump expended going down the stretch was indeed Herculean. There is no question that his final push into Wisconsin, Michigan, and returning to western Pennsylvania, was an act of pure will that, while Clinton was already celebrating, propelled him to victory. The 2016 election was the first in which the mainstream media lost its monopoly over political media coverage in the United States. The increasingly vigorous alternative media, whose reporting standards are superior to the networks and the cable news behemoths, is where more and more voters are getting their information. Trump\u2019s skillful courting of the conservative media, like The Daily Caller, Breitbart News, WND.com, and InfoWars, made Trump the first presidential candidate to reach these disaffected and highly motivated Americans effectively. At the same time, Trump\u2019s relentless attacks on the media as \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d came right out of the Nixon playbook, where both Nixon and Trump exploited the resentment of the biased media, so hated by their supporters. Trump\u2019s willingness to challenge openly the media outlets that went after him kept them somewhat honest in their coverage of his campaign but the relentless cable news networks\u2019 attacks on him were unlike any\u00adthing I have seen in the nine presidential campaigns in which I worked. The media dropped all pretext of objectivity. Their motives and tactics were naked. Most of this would largely backfire. American voters have finally become hip to the fact that the media and the political establishment work hand-in-glove to conceal many facts from the American people. The voters no longer believe the media. Donald Trump is his own strategist, campaign manager, and tactician, and all credit for his incredible election belongs to him. I\u2019m just glad to have been along for the ride. I wanted him to run for President since 1988 and had served as chairman of his Presidential Exploratory Committee in 2000, as well as serving as a consultant to his 2012 consideration of a candidacy. I have worked for Trump with the Trump Organization, the Trump Shuttle, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, and several political explorations over a forty-year period. He is perhaps the greatest salesman in US history, with the spirit of a promoter and the infectious enthusiasm of an entrepreneur who likes making money and winning. Trump waged the first modern \u201call communication\u201d campaign, eschewing polling, expensive television advertising, sophisticated analytics, and all of the traditional tools of a modern presidential campaign. At the same time, Trump\u2019s campaign was centered around a \u201cset piece rally,\u201d just as Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign had been. That Trump ran as the candidate of \u201cthe Silent Majority,\u201d appealing to forgotten Americans, running as the law and order candidate and in the end, the peace candidate, was not accidental. Trump\u2019s campaign was much like Nixon\u2019s. He understood that politics is about big issues, concepts, and themes, and that the voters didn\u2019t really care about wonkish detail. If they had, then Newt Gingrich would have been president. Although there are similarities between Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory in 1980 and Trump\u2019s ascendancy to the presidency, Trump\u2019s election is less an ideological victory and more a manifestation of a genuine desire for a more competent government. Like Nixon, Trump is more pragmatic, interested in what will work, as opposed to what is philosophically pure. He\u2019s tired of seeing America lose. He is exactly the cheerleader the country needs. Like Truman\u2019s whistle-stop events, Trump rallies became the focal point of his entire campaign, amplified by the cable news networks that carried his rally speeches around the clock. He drew enormous crowds and voters found him funny and genuine. All the while, his trusted press aide Hope Hicks was booking as many one-on-one interviews into his schedule as humanly possible. There was literally a time when you could not turn on the television without seeing and hearing Donald Trump. The cable networks of course did it for the ratings. The fact that Trump was unrehearsed, un-coached, and unhandled, meant that voters found him refreshing and authentic.

The site\u2019s mission statement reads: \u201cSanctuary restaurants have a zero tolerance policy for sexism, racism, and xenophobia. We believe that there is a place at the table for all\u2026 Sanctuary Restaurants offer support and resources to workers, restaurants, and consumers to help create the world we want to see \u2013 a world free from hate, discrimination, and harassment.\u201d The organization caters to the LGBT community, inviting \u201cpeople of all genders, gender identities and gender expressions,\u201d along with their primary objective to protect the \u201crights\u201d of \u201cimmigrant workers.\u201d While legal immigrant workers share the same rights as natural-born American citizens, illegal immigrants are not entitled to those rights \u2013 a concept leftists often fail to understand, or actively work to undermine. Presente.org describes its mission \u201cto advance Latinx power and create winning campaigns that amplify Latinx voices; expand the political imagination and traditional boundaries; and foster inspiration for freedom, equity, and justice. Presente is the largest national Latinx online organization advancing social justice with technology, media, and culture.\u201d \u201cLatinx\u201d is a new term created by pronoun-obsessed SJWs, and is meant to replace the gender connotations of \u201cLatino/Latina.\u201d \u201cLatinx, pronounced \u2018La-teen-ex,\u2019 includes the numerous people of Latin American descent whose gender identities fluctuate along different points of the spectrum, from\u00a0agender\u00a0or\u00a0nonbinary\u00a0to\u00a0gender non-conforming,\u00a0genderqueer\u00a0and\u00a0genderfluid,\u201d explains Latina.com Presente.org is deeply involved in attacking the Trump administration as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacist,\u201d while ROCU\u2019s site contains similarly themed articles proclaiming, \u201cTrump\u2019s Misogyny Is Sickening!\u201d SanctuaryRestaurants.org offers a \u2018Resources\u2019 page for workers that encourages them to challenge employers who attempt to verify their work authorization, likely in anticipation of renewed enforcement of immigration laws by the Trump Administration.  A downloadable \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d flyer is also available, to be referenced \u201cIn the Event of a Raid or Immigration Action\u201d \u2013   Estimates put the number of illegal aliens working in the restaurant industry at around 1.3 million out of 12 million overall workers, according to ROCU\u2019s own admission. A Pew Research study in 2008 found that approximately 20% of all restaurant cooks were \u2018undocumented immigrants,\u2019 and that over 8 million illegals were in the U.S. labor force, a number that inevitably increased during the Obama presidency. It is no secret that, while immigrant workers are arguably necessary in the service industries, illegals who fly under the radar drive down wages for all employees in the sector, and also enable both illegal employee and law-breaking employer to skirt tax and insurance rules that businesses operating lawfully are not able to avoid. Sanctuary Restaurants have no legal standing for their cause, which amounts to nothing more than virtue signaling and thumbing their noses at the rule of law, but it does serve as an excellent resource for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, whose staff will soon be tripled.

Conservative Humiliates Anti-Trump Protester", "body": "Kevin Martin, a black conservative politician, respectfully hammered a white anti-Trump protester with facts about black-on-black crime until she fled the scene, while onlookers applauded the young man for his efforts.  In a video that has been viewed by well over five million people at the time of this writing, Martin begins by telling the shocked woman that Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organization. \u201cYou allow Black Lives Matter on campus, but you don\u2019t allow White Power on campus. Why not? It\u2019s the same sh*t. Both are hate groups and neither are productive. If you denounce one, denounce the other.\u201d The woman, holding a \u201cLock Him Up!\u201d sign (referring to President Donald Trump), exhibited her illiberal intolerance for Martin\u2019s arguments, dismissing him as \u201can anomaly.\u201d \u201cWow\u2026 I\u2019m not even going to engage in something so absurd. This is just ridiculous,\u201d she scoffed at Martin. Martin continued on, speaking about the disproportionate number of blacks as a percentage of the U.S. population (~13%) in relation to their participation in gun and drug crime, which is over half. He also noted that roughly 95% of violent offenses against blacks are perpetrated by other blacks, saying, \u201cI have a 2,000% more likelihood to be shot by another black man, leaving this event, than I do by a white person, a police officer, or a neo-Nazi\u2026 African-Americans are killing each other. That\u2019s what the problem is.\u201d The woman realized she had been routed and walked away in a daze, while onlookers applauded Martin. \u201cI can\u2019t even hang out in black neighborhoods, because it\u2019s a risk for me. It\u2019s sad,\u201d Martin continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem within the African-American community, and it needs to be addressed.\u201d \u201cObama didn\u2019t address it because he needed the black vote, and Al Sharpton didn\u2019t address it because he\u2019s making millions of dollars off of victimizing African-Americans.\u201d Kevin Martin is an activist and aspiring politician who has set his sights on the governorship of Pennsylvania. As a conservative and supporter of President Donald Trump, he embodies a change of the tide for black Americans, who have been abused, used and mistreated by the Democratic Party for decades.
